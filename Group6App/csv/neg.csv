Open 24 hours a day, there is always a line. We dutifully got in line which seemed to me should take about 20 min, given the fact that they are just handing you a product and there are multiple cashiers. Well, after an hour, we were finally inside the place. It is obviously garish with plenty of primary colors, goofiness, and double entendres. It is part of the whole schtick, so it's to be expected.

The displays showed their wide range of donuts which are designed to have visual wow factor, mainly via toppings like breakfast cereal or various icing patterns. We ordered four doughnuts to sample, one of which is their famed Bacon Maple Bar. The cashier was nice enough and we headed outdoors to picnic tables for sampling.

Boring. Or I should say: ordinary. We are basically talking Dunkin Donuts with ""unusual"" toppings and cute names. The Bacon Maple Bar is an ordinary maple bar with a couple of slices of decent bacon on it. I suppose since Dunkin Donuts has both maple bars and bacon slices you could probably bribe them to make you an equivalent for the $2.50 price tag.

The only donut that was in any way noteworthy was the Arnold Palmer, which was a cake doughnut with vanilla frosting and lemonade/iced tea powder. It was tasty enough.

The bottom line is go to Dunkin Donuts or any other decent local place and get doughnuts. Embellish them at home with bacon, cocoa puffs, or fruit loops and call it good. The schtick is simply not worth wasting an hour in Portland.",2011-08-24 21:59:48

The lines are always long just to get inside, but the real inconvenience is that they are cash only. You would think that as time progressed that they would adapt to accepting checks as well as credit or debit. So what's stopping them?

As you wait in line, you may find yourselves harassed by street characters who will ask you for money. I was once standing in line and this one homeless guy berated the whole crowd because nobody would give him a quarter. One of Old Town's problems is the homeless population which is quite neglected by the City of Portland. There's also a strong police presence in Old Town, so it'd be both nice and convenient if they could send more patrols to pass by Voodoo and through Ankeny Alley. That way patrons could feel a little less bothered.

To top it all off, the donuts are not really all that good. I mean, they're not bad, but they're not all that great either. They're more colorful and creative than they are delicious. I'll still give Voodoo props for being original and helping to put Portland on the map, but that is about it.

I go into Old Town quite a bit and actually pass by this donut shop a lot, but ironically, in the past several years I've only been to this shop three times. I'm still willing to give them a chance because they are an unquestionable slice of Portland, but I wish they would make some serious improvements. I mean already they've made their sidewalk much more pedestrian-friendly and added a whole outdoor eating area. Hopefully, there will be more patrols in the area and fewer vagrants harassing customers.

I've heard the story so many times. Your founders got high and walked around a grocery store and came up with your donut ideas. They then found a piece of commercial real estate in the once-defunct Old Town district next to a hentai theater in the 90's and got really lucky with the way that Portland decided to expand. Their silly little donut shop now lives at the heart of Portland's tourism industry. A cheap product that can be made in mass and delivered to a cheap consumer. The McDonald's of bakeries. It's a win-win situation for anyone hoping to consume 500 calories for under $1.

But oh, Voodoo, oh how I despise you. I hate your long lines regardless of the day or season. I hate the way that everyone who visits me in this city insists on going to Voodoo while they're in town, and how I have to stand their with my rolling eyes and crossed arms and pretend to be happy to take them to your establishment. I hate your tired ""pink boxes"" jokes. I hate the way you've made ""maple bacon"" a thing now. I just hate you, and you don't deserve it, but I still hate you.

You get two stars, though, for having an excellent reputation as an employer. You provide those who work for you with a livable wage and health care options.

Donuts range from the odd and controversial: Voodoo Doll, Cock-N-Balls (yes - literally shaped as such), Gay Bar, Old Dirty Bastard;  to the funky:  Captain My Captain, The Loop, Bacon Maple Bar (topped with 2 real strips) and for those who prefer to stick to the basics, fear not -- there are ""normal"" flavours on the menu:  cinnamon sugar, regular glaze, chocolate glaze, toasted coconut, to name a few.  

Not a sweets fan in general and especially not donuts to begin with, but in judging the taste and texture of the donuts themselves, without the scary icing and toppings, Voodoo is leaps and bounds better than places like Krispy Kreme (too lardy) and Tim Horton's (bone-dry) for Canadians.  So far I have tried cinnamon sugar, glazed, toasted coconut and buttermilk bar.  Why so boring?  I like to taste the real deal, without all the weird jazz.  Too much noise to distract from the basic goods.  Besides, all that funky artificial food colouring makes my stomach churn so no thanks.  

Figured that once is plenty previously as all donuts are way too sweet for my taste but I still managed a repeat on my recent trip to Portland.  For all donut and sugar fiends, as well as anyone else who has never been there, I would say Voodoo is worth the trip.  Lineups during the day can be long but being 24-7, going there during non-peak hours is recommended.

Oh, and Stumptown is just a stone's throw away - literally a very short block.  Talk about hitting two of Portland's must-visit spots with one stone!  ;0)",2012-09-11 05:46:24

I'm kind of disappointed. Voodoo donuts has an excellent marketing scheme with its whole darkly magical, fantastical theme and its 24/7 convenience so that you can satisfy your fried sugary goodness cravings any time you heart (or your stomach!) wishes. Having said that however, it just wasn't worth the hype, atleast when I went. The donuts themselves were a let down for the most part. The classical four donuts we got were recommended by the guy behind the counter as some of the most popular: chocolate coconut, neopolitan, butterfingering and raspberry romeo. With the exception of raspberry romeo, they all had a dry, thick cakey texture with stale, cracked glaze/frosting. It has a huge let down and nobody ended up finishing them. The raspberry romeo was somewhat soft and chewy and was the best out of the classical four. We also got Maple Bacon Donut and the Memphis Mafia Donut which are larger and more atypical. The Maple Donut was my favorite donut for the delicious combination of textures (real bacon on a maple syrup glazed donut) and flavors. The Mephis Mafia Donut was more of a fritter than a donut and was also good but being covered in chocolate frosting, peanut butter, peanuts and chocolate chips, it was a little too much for me. Overall, I think you should definitely try Voodoo Donuts but if you buy into the buzz surrounding it, you're setting yourself up for a little disappointment.

So sweet you can get a toothache! I really did not like them. 

I tasted one of the donuts and tossed it in the garbage can. 

I gave the rest of the donuts to my co-workers. 

Don't expect to get the ""cocks and balls"" or ""the gay bar"". They always run out of those. 

Plus did you know that there are mounting evidence suggests that flooding your system with sugar can play a role in corpulence, heart illness, and sarcoma? It can also impact how you look or feel, doing destruction to your skin or shifting your mood to cause melancholy. Surely the work of an evil entity. They even have a devil donut.

The cashier was pretty snappy and not pleased to answer my questions about donut flavors. When I asked what the blue and pink donut on display was, she said it was called Miami Vice and tasted just like the drink. I told her I didn't know what the drink tasted like, and she gave me a 'wtf' look and described as 'artificial berry'. Not sold. I ended ordering the famous voodoo donut and a blueberry cake donut. They were both good, but not any better than the donuts from local convenience stores in California. I think going to Voodoo was a good experience, but I would not come back solely for the donuts.

The donuts honestly aren't that great.  Yes they're pretty hilarious to look at, but taste-wise they're mediocre.  My biggest complaint is that most of them are way too sweet, to the point that it masks the other flavours the donuts are supposed to have.  With that said, the tradeoff is that the prices seem much more reasonable.

1) They only accept CASH only.
2) Expect waiting in line.
3) The dozen box of doughnuts come with regular, but colorful doughnuts like frostings covered in coco puffs, fruit loops, sprinkles and etc. It does not include their specialties like the voodoo doll or cock-n-balls. You can request those in your dozen, but the prices will vary.

I've heard about Voodoo Doughnuts all the way from San Diego and I was able to finally check during my visit to Portland. 

The place is quirky and wacky. Pink colored stuff everywhere (reminds me of Luche Libre back in San Diego). There are usually long lines. I came around 10:00 am on a Thursday morning and I was at the cash register in 15 minutes. I must've got lucky because around 10:30am, the line was much longer.

I'll give it to them that the doughnuts appearance are fun and creative. However, the taste of the doughnuts are mediocre. They're dense and average tasting. I got a dozen of the regular doughnuts and the cereal on a few doughnuts were stale.

It's a must visit if you're from out of town visiting Portland for the first time. For me, I'll probably only visit it again if I wanted to show family and friends around Portland. Would I want to buy their doughnuts again? Probably not. It's one of those things you must try at least once in your life.",2016-07-15 06:06:29

So what can I say about this place. Voodoo donuts is a place where they sell really interesting and odd donuts you don't normally see. These are the donuts that are sold in those famous pink boxes. They also have very inserting names for there donuts. They really sweet and some are really big. I think this place is more like a tourist place now then a regular donut shop. It fun to go to, but not all the time. I think it a once in a while kind of place for me. 

So there always a big line here, at night time when people are drunk or people want something sweet after the club this is the place they go to. I would recommend it if you just want to be where everyone is at and willing to stand in line and if you really like sweet stuff.",2013-11-14 17:43:29

If you can get past that, and find your way into the line, you will be waiting a while. But you can people watch (which is quite a show there), and listen to a DJ that is entertaining. Thus, I didn't mind the wait.

+ Variety of donuts
- Long wait
- Cash only
- Under cooked donut - memphis mafia's center was still really gooey and doughy, semi-raw
- Really bad guitar playing hipster kids hanging out in front of the shop while you wait in line singing dreadful emo songs - and because you are waiting in line, you are the forced audience

Boo. This was a letdown. I was looking forward to having a couple of good donuts during the trip - unfortunately, it didn't turn out that way. Ridiculous long line to get into the shop on a Saturday afternoon - if you are thinking about trying it out, I suggest to not go on a Saturday afternoon unless waiting is your thing.

Multiple people in line were asking if this place was any good. Everybody's in line is a tourist it seems. Not that it's a bad thing but I kind of get suspicious when no locals are willing to go to a place. Not only the line was long but there were a group of kids singing horrible mopey songs horribly in front of you. You can't get away. You must endure. The only clapping and applauding after each song is coming from their own group. Picture a dog licking its butt - yeah, now you're with me.

The long wait failed to mask the penultimate disappointment when we finally got the donuts. The voodoo doll was average - the filling was really over the top. The Memphis Mafia wasn't fully cooked. The middle of the donut had semi-raw dough. Ugh.",2013-05-29 19:27:14

I have heard how awesome Voodoo doughnuts are from a friend of mine that used to live there as well as others and from Tv (foodnetwork i believe) of course. So i made it a must to stop by Portland just to have these doughnuts which were very good. 

The customer service experience wasn't a good. There was no line but two very unhappy irritated looking girls are the counter both with black hair a slightly ""chubby"" one and a thin girl with a Septum piercing.
When we walked in we stood off to the side to look at what we hand wanted before going to the counter there was NO line btw.
When we asked started picking out what we wanted the girl was clearly annoyed. She asked us if we had been here before and we had said no and she gave us an annoyed look and said ""you havent been to Voodoo before"" with the tone as if we were completely mentally challenged. We said that 1 dozen will do and began picking out what we thought would be cool to try. She then said the Voodoo dozen is the best way to go but we couldnt pick out any doughnuts (right away a bell went off in my head thinking shit im going to get the cheapest thing here) but she assured us that it was the best way to pick variety so i reluctantly agreed, seeing as all the doughnuts were unique. I had specifically asked for multiple maple bacon bars. she grabbed the dougnuts from a speed rack and handed us the closed box and gave us the total. 
we walked out feeling majorly disappointed with how rude their workers are.

Got the car and what appeared in the box was VERY average looking doughtnuts not worth the extra time to go and certainly not the rude employees. Not one Maple Bacon Bar was in that box, I wouldn't have cared to pay more for them if she had just pulled her head out of her ass and said their are none in the box. 
They were soo rude i didnt even want to go back inside to buy the six additional maple bacon bars that i was excited in trying. The only doughnut that looked unusual or an ""VOODOO"" assortment was a glazed doughnut with captin crunch and another with coco puffs.Two doughnuts out of 12!! best way to get an assortment my ass !

My friend and I came in and ordered ten donuts for us to share amongst our group of 5 college friends. Here are the donuts that we ordered. Anything with an asterisk is one that I would order again.

The donuts looked really cool (we couldn't even figure out which ones to get because we were overwhelmed) so we did the voodoo dozen, where they choose for you. We got a nice mix of everything, from the cereal topped ones, to a cinnamon one with sprinkles, to an oreo one.

Over here in Dunkin' Donuts territory, I sometimes feel the word is in danger of losing its silent letters forever, à la the commonplace and ridiculous spelling of ""drive-thru."" 

Grammatical considerations aside, I was excited to go see the selection of vegan doughnuts at Voodoo, a mecca for hip kids and drunkards (as it's near a lot of late-night bars in downtown Portland) as well as for vegans tired of missing out on fluffy, sticky, delicious sweetness.  Midday on a Thursday (Christmas Eve, actually) the line for Voodoo snaked not quite out the door and the air was thick with the scent of sugar. 

Now, Voodoo is the kind of place you go for the novelty, really. With a bacon-draped maple bar and doughnuts festooned with Fruit Loops and crushed Butterfingers, the point here is as much the entertainment value as it is the flavor. My brother and mom selected six regular doughnuts (although there's nothing much normal about a giant chocolate doughnut dredged in Oreos) and I asked for an assortment of six vegan ones. 

We spent the next couple days sampling the doughnuts little slices at a time, because there's really only so much fat and sugar that's appealing to an adult before you start craving an apple or some nice steamed broccoli. In general, I'd say the vegan doughnuts were so-so. My assortment included cake and glazed varieties, one with what tasted like grape Pixie Stix powder on top, a couple with blah vanilla glaze and sprinkles, one with what appeared to be (and tasted like) orange crayon shavings, and one maple-glazed (with which you can never go wrong!). Maybe Voodoo puts too much emphasis on the sugary glaze and toppings and not enough on the taste and consistency of the dough itself. Or maybe I'm just not a sweets fanatic. 

Still, I definitely recommend stopping by Voodoo if you're in the Portland area.",2010-01-11 18:53:08

Now, I do love donuts.  I really, really love donuts.  But only good donuts, not crappy donuts.  These donuts didn't look great, the frosting seemed slim.  There was all sorts of crap on them that don't belong on donuts (bacon, cereal etc.)  They didn't look appetizing but I figured I might as well give them a shot since I had the chance.  I think that it was the first time in 20 years that I did not finish a donut.

When did donuts become food for kids?  When did we decide to put things on donuts that look like they are going to a classroom full of 2nd graders?  Why is there a kid's cereal on a donut, and why do we do we accept it, and eat it.  Instead of thinking of the next crazy thing to put on a donut, why don't you just focus on making a really good donut?  

But Voodoo will not do that, they will continue to make bad donuts will stupid stuff on them, that people will continue to line up outside because they want to follow the crowd because it's the cool thing to do, and I will continue to have to listen to people praise this place, and I'll have to argue with them for either following the crowd, or for just having really bad taste.

FOOD:
The Bacon Maple Bar, the Apple Fritter and the Mango Tango were all awesome! Damn good at 1am and what's left over is perfect for breakfast.

SERVICE: 
The donuts are double the price they should be (the novelty of it.. just like those ultra high-end cupcakes that exist). The Donut Nazi taking the orders can learn to be a little nicer, especially for someone who has never been there before and you want to ask a question.

DRUNK PEOPLE WATCH OUT!!!!
They take advantage of people by giving $1 coins as change. I witnessed this while standing in line... and the guy tried to pull it on me. You should have seen his face when I didn't drop any change in the tip jar and pulled out a dollar bill instead. If I would have dropped the change like I normally do they would have taken $4+ more dollars from me.

The interior of the store is very interesting (gothic, hipster, punk, etc...) and there's even a rotating glass case full of donuts to give you a look of what their donuts look like. There is a wide variety of donuts to choose from so you'll be sure to find one that suits your desires. 

Instead of opting to get a donut to enjoy, I decided to do the Tex-Ass Challenge after hearing and seeing about it. WOW. The Tex-Ass Challenge is where you have to eat a Tex-Ass donut (basically a HUGE glazed donut equivalent to 6 normal glazed donuts) in under 80 seconds. If you succeed, you get a pin and Voodoo pays for your donut, roughly $5. I totally underestimated the size of the donut. In photos, the donut doesn't look too big but once you start shoving it in your mouth, it's sooo thick. I failed miserably...I only ate half of the donut in 80 seconds. I was so disappointed in myself...luckily there was no one else in the store!! I took the rest to-go and after taking a few bites, the donut wasn't the best I ever had.

The concept of Voodoo when it opened was hilarious and intriguing but that was many years ago now. When they first opened they had toppings like NyQuil and crushed up Pepto. ""YES!"" everyone said in unison. Then the FDA or someone decided that wasn't okay and that they had to go with stale cereal instead.

The others I tried were overly sweet. Specifically, the voodoo doughnut was too sweet where there was no jelly, but too tart where jelly was. 

I went at 10pm and there was a line of about 40 people. There were also panhandlers outside the shop, but I'm not going to factor these into the star rating.

The doughnuts here are not bad but neither are the doughnuts at Safeway, Fred Meyer or Albertsons.  Don't be fooled by the lines wrapping around the block, they are all tourists too.  

Yes, the doughnuts have funny, clever names.  Yes, the bacon maple bar is good, almost as good as going to the grocery store, buying a couple maple bars and some bacon and making them yourself (yes, we've done this.)

If you want a truly amazing doughnut go to one of the many fantastic doughnut shops in town; Annie's, Blue Star, Pips Original to name a few.

Voodoo Doughnut is a must if:
a) You want a picture in front of the sign to show your friends back home.
b) You want to get married in a doughnut shop (yeah, for real.)
c) You're craving a good fritter.  To their credit they do make some pretty good fritters but be prepared to pay for it, they are not cheap by doughnut standards.

One more thing, if you get some doughnuts to go make sure you eat the ones with the kiddy cereal on top right away because that cereal will be stale by tomorrow morning.

If you come to Portland and you like donuts it's worth going for the ""experience"".  If you are someone who loves going to different donut spots, you will find this place overpriced and overrated like I did.  

If you want to spend 8 bucks for donut that looks like a blunt or a penis then I guess have at it.  I tried the grape ( too sweet), maple bacon ( bacon was old, look up Friendly's in Orange as a way to make it), and a lemon donut ( I actually liked it). If I come back here I would try the basic donuts only. 

I come up to the Northwest 1-2x a year and will try a different place next time ( I'm hearing about Blue Star), for now I will stick to the Donuttery for my donut fix.   Thanks!!

We waited in line for about 30 minutes which is fine. I've waited in longer lines for food.... However, when you get inside there's only 3 cashiers and 3 registers... with a line that long why not have someone take orders while the other person rings. Would be much faster... 

On top of that their customer service sucks. The guy we ordered from was too busy singing along with the music to worry about guest service. Also instead of bagging or boxing our doughnuts, brought each one and tossed them on the counter or on top of each other. 

In terms of the doughnuts we ordered 1 bacon. maple bar, 1 old dirty bastard, 1 voodoo man and 1 mango tango. They're nothing special as far as doughnuts go. They taste like regular doughnuts ... maybe a bit sweeter. The voodoo man is only filled half way with the raspberry filling which left a bunch of dough left over. The mango tango was a weird combination of tart and sweet filling. The only thing that's special about their doughnuts is they're shaped nice.

So...for someone who doesn't eat donuts, I waited in line for 45 minutes at 10am, while harassed by ...not so talented street performers... to get a taste of donuts that do not inspire beyond their unique physical attributes. They tasted, at least to my simple tongue, the same as every dunkin' donut pastry that I've ever had. The only reason why this place didn't get 1 star is that their donuts are fairly cheap and not over priced, which they definitely could get away for. As a result, since Voodoo Doughnut is a Portland special and there are some unique flavors and shapes, it deserves 3 stars for recognition.

After my experience, I feel that ""Voodoo"" stands for ""Very Overtly Obvious Discrimination Of Other.""

Doughnuts: They have a wide variety of interesting combinations ranging from sugar-rush-inducing cereal or candy toppings to your run-of-the-mill cream/jelly filled doughnuts . The taste of the doughnut itself is typical, nothing special - it's the toppings that make their doughnuts unique.  If you go, I would recommend the Bacon Maple Bar doughnut (there are two slices of real bacon). Overall, nothing to write home about, and certainly more hype than yumminess.

Ambiance: Located in a less... delectable part of the city, be prepared to see some establishments not suitable for young eyes.  It's a small location that serves its purpose.  There's a small small standing table along one of the walls where you can eat your doughnuts if you don't want to walk around them.

Service: Insulting. I had read that sometimes the servers can be terse, but my friend and I were treated differently because of the color of our skin.  Our encounter: My friend told the brunette woman behind the counter that this was our first time in Portland in hopes of hearing a little bit about the menu, but we received a stony stare.  I thought to myself ""maybe she's having a long/bad day,"" and asked what were her favorites.  She pointed to a couple with lackluster effort, and my friend and I just ordered three doughnuts to try.  Our server then proceeded to give us our doughnuts in those little parchment paper slips.  I thought it was weird because other people had gotten little baggies, but maybe it's because we only ordered three. What I saw afterwards made my blood boil.  The two women who were behind us - who were Caucasian - were treated COMPLETELY differently.  They were chatted up (by the same server) with friendly smile and fanfare (and no, I don't think they were the server's friends), and while they only ordered two doughnuts, they received each one in a separate bag (without being asked).  When I went up to ask for a bag, I got an impatient look (there were no other customers) and a reluctant one bag.  While Voodoo probably doesn't need to care that much about customer service due to its large patronage, I would hope they would at least catch up to the 21st century and not practice discrimination.

Pricing: Reasonable.  Cash only.

I came here while visiting Portland a few weeks ago not because I particularly wanted a donut, but because I felt like I should get one since I was in Portland only for a few days. 

The line wasn't as long as it typically is; we waited about 20 minutes. We planned ahead and brought cash, and thank goodness we did, because the ATM inside was out of order. The poor folks in front of us waited all that time and couldn't even take cash out. A sign outside would have been nice. 

I had the Portland Cream and my husband had the Maple Bacon. He enjoyed the Maple Bacon although took about half the frosting off because it was so darn sweet. Mine was also sweet but not too sweet. I know they claim to make their donuts fresh each day, but mine was actually pretty stale under the frosting. 

We left feeling silly for going out of our way to get cash back at 711 and then waiting in line for these donuts that we didn't enjoy that much. I think it's a place everyone should go to once, but I will probably skip it next time I'm in town.",2017-07-20 17:01:21

1. They are a sugary nightmare or a sugary dream depending on how you see it.  Most of the donuts are overly sweet.  While unique and often tasty, the sheer amount of sugar can send anyone's sugar levels off the chart.

2. They do not accept debit/credit cards.  I get it, you pay a transaction fee as a business everytime someone swipes their card, but by not accepting cards you basically force the poor out of towner who has never been to your shop to pay an ATM fee so they can try your donuts.  Thats bad business in my opinion.  There are great solutions like Square that charge 2.75% per swipe.  So that $3 that your customer just bought with their credit card, you lost 8 cents.  Where with your ATM, if you get half the fees back that it charges the customer, you just made an additional $1.25 on that $3 donut.  Again bad business.

3.  To go along with the extra money that you are extracting from customers who do not bring cash, the donuts here are not cheap.  If you try to chose your own dozen, expect to pay at least $20.

So all in all, try it once for the experience, but just make sure you bring cash.",2015-02-17 16:58:44

As far as quality and taste goes, their donuts are not a whole lot better than what you would find at most of your other neighborhood doughnut shops. Other ""boutique"" doughnut places such as Dynamo Donuts in San Francisco are a leg up in terms of taste.  But the doughnuts here are an absolute visual feast.  Take for example, a doughnut that Food Network did not mention in DDD - the Cock n Balls doughnut.  

If you easily get offended by things that are sexual in nature please do not read any further as I am going to describe the best way to eat this doughnut.  If you easily get turned on by things that are sexual in nature, please remember that I am only talking about eating a particular doughnut and nothing else should be construed concerning my sexual orientation, occupation, or what I would do for crack.

The first thing that you will notice with the aforementioned doughnut is that it is a rather large and unwieldy monstrosity. It really requires that you handle with both hands otherwise you will just have a mess ending up all over your face.  If you are into that, then you may proceed to do so by all means.  Carefully cradle it by the base and start with the elongated portion and taste the chocolatey goodness.  This way you can start off light.  As you get toward the base of the doughnut, you will notice a shift in the weight distribution - this is because you have already gone through about a good 8 inches and what you are left with is the portion that is the true reward - the cream filling. You need to be extra careful here since just chomping for the cream will have it squirting out everywhere.  If you don't get that initial portion, don't worry, just give the base a light squeeze and you will eventually have some of that tasty filling in your mouth.  Then as your confidence builds, you can continue to eat the rest, all the while, being careful not to let all of the cream out.  If you just can't wait to get to the cream portion, then go straight for the base.  Ultimately, you will then be filled with ecstasy or guilt (depending on your upbringing) at the realization that you ate the equivalent of two doughnuts - a chocolate bar and a chocolate covered eclair!  Of course, you can always share and even eat the thing simultaneously.

As far as the other doughnuts were concerned, I thought that the Oreo doughnut was the next best as the glaze tasted just like the cream filling of the Oreo, and had crushed Oreos all over.  I found their fritter type doughnuts a bit too greasy and heavy.  The maple bar with bacon is decent, but the large strips of bacon made it a bit unwieldy and would have been better if they were cut into smaller pieces. So go here for pure entertainment and curiosity value and you will not be disappointed.",2012-04-03 02:06:29

It's almost impossible to get a donut without an hour long wait.

5 years ago the place was run by an eclectic combination of young punk-rockers and (genuine) Portlandians who knew the neighborhood and the characters that made it what it was.
One of the last times I was there I went in for a donut one night (right before close) a few days before Christmas. The kids behind the counter were bagging up several large bags of donuts. I asked what it was for and they said they were extras. So, they were going to pass them out to the homeless around the neighborhood.
I ended up helping.
I gave my bag to a woman sleeping beneath the Burnside bridge with her husband.
I don't think I will ever forget that Christmas or those two kids.

The next time my friends and I went in it took us 35 minutes to get a couple of donuts and some coffee. The obnoxious hipster girl behind the counter was curt, pointlessly rude, and I swore I would never go back.

This place was cool 5 years ago.

Walking by Voodoo and seeing that line of people who just want to be able to say they held a pink box is like seeing a line of people waiting an hour to buy Folger's  with a Coava next door, or seeing movie stars waiting in line to hug a wet dog when they could be at home making love to their beautiful spouses.

2. Portland Creme: Supposedly Portland's official donut and its a chocolate layered, Bavarian Creme donut with a soft and light cake.  I like it better than Dunkin's Boston Creme Pie. The wife ended up eating most of it.

3. Mexican Hot Chocolate: The cake was a bit heavier and denser than expected, and man that cayenne pepper really puts a number on your lips!

I had been craving a donut for a long time so this was a nice retreat. The donuts were a Mango Tango and a Memphis Mafia. I was surprised to find that these donuts were still really fresh even all the way from Portland.

The Mango Tango is a raised yeast donut so it's really fluffy. The insides are filled with mango jelly while the top is frosted with white vanilla frosting and another layer of orange frosting. It kinda looks like a Krispy Kreme donut with an orange toupee. When I first tried the donut I thought it was apricot filling. I was quite surprised that it was supposed to be mango. I would bypass the purchase of this donut unless you're a big fan of sweets. The insides feel like a huge glob of corn syrup or simple syrup with artificial flavorings. The dough itself is good but I don't think it needed vanilla frosting on top. It's more like decoration than additional deliciousness. The insides are sweet enough.


The Memphis Mafia, according Voodoo Donut's website is ""Fried dough with banana chunks and cinnamon sugar covered in a glaze with chocolate frosting, peanut butter, peanuts and chocolate chips on top!"" I'm pretty surprised at how many ingredients there are because I only tasted a few of them. Maybe because the donut suffers from the same problem as the Mango Tango? TOO SWEET. I couldn't taste the peanut butter, cinnamon, peanuts, chocolate chips, or cinnamon sugar. I did however like this donut a lot more than the Mango Tango. Since the dough is fried and glazed it has a crunchy shell while the dough still has a softness to it. The banana is a savior although there is not enough of it.

If your taste buds are maximized to 100% sweetness, it's really difficult to taste anything else. Adding more is actually getting less. The quality of the donuts and ingenuity at Voodoo Doughnut is awesome; still, the execution and balance of flavors is hardly anywhere near impressive. Please balance those flavors and control the sweetness.",2010-08-28 14:51:13

There was plenty to look at on the walls. I felt like I was in a doughnut themed Amoeba record store. 

The cashiers are very friendly and surprisingly quite patient considering the line of anxious customers that is likely non-stop throughout their shifts. Prices of the doughnuts are not cheap considering they are doughnuts. The actual taste of the doughnuts was quite tasty and very fresh (almost too fresh because some of the chocolate frosting smeared on most of the other doughnuts) although the uniqueness of the doughnuts are merely cosmetic. Still you'll get a good chuckle out of some of their creations.

All things considered, as a tourist Voodoo Doughnuts was worth the visit. The price and the wait are some of the biggest deterrents to this Portland attraction.

We ordered the Triple Chocolate Penetration (chocolate cake doughnut, chocolate frosting and coco puffs) for $1.25, Miami Vice Berry (vanilla frosting, blue raspberry powder, pink sprinkles) for  $1.50,  Dirt Doughnut (vanilla frosting and oreos), Old Dirty Bastard (chocolate frosting, oreos and peanut butter) for $1.75

The donuts had super sweet frosting that I dislike cause I feel a diabetic attack coming on. The dough didn't taste fresh. So all in all it was exciting standing in line with the others but I'd probably do it again NEVER...

If u go its Cash only so bring cash!! Btw the line got even longer when we walked out.

I've heard about it from so many people who have visited Portland.  I've seen it on the Food Network.  I guess I had high expectations but I thought their donuts were way too sweet and not that good.

First off there is a long line that is out the door.  It goes by pretty quick so you don't have to worry if you see a long line.  The inside of the place is really small.  They have cashiers who can help you but it's hard to tell which donuts are which unless you ask.  The menu is also displayed on the wall but it's hard to match each description to the exact donut in the display case.  I felt like it was almost too much for me to keep asking the cashier what each of the donuts were in the case and what was inside each of the donuts.  

They definitely have unique flavors and pretty much anything sweet that you can slap on a donut.  We ordered a regular chocolate donut so we could compare a regular donut to a regular donut shop back at home.  And we also ordered another chocolate donut that had peanut butter and rice krispies on top.  

The rice krispies were stale and the donut itself was not good.  The regular chocolate donut was okay but overall, both donuts were super sweet.  I guess we should've ordered the Maple Bacon Bar but overall, I think this place has really super heavy donuts that are too sweet and too rich.  It's also not worth the hype of actually ordering and eating one of these.

I got the captain crunch which was recommended to me by a staff member. He was nice and actually had a lot to recommend me but was quite indecisive himself..lol.

I probably only wanted to try it cuz I wanted to say at least I had voodoo donuts while in Portland when I was there. I think their donuts are cool, interesting, and unique in terms of look but did not win me over in terms of taste.

The shop itself is small, very cluttered with various things, kinda makes it *shrugs*, I can't think of the word, but whatever. Inside the shop it smells like old Halloween candy, mainly old tootsie rolls. Also, it reaks outside, probably due to the garbage and the whatnot, but it stinks.

I am not sure if they have just worn thin dealing with the tourist or the crackheads which surround and even enter the building begging for money but it is completely unacceptable. I guess it must be the ""i don't give a f*** attitude"" that keeps me coming back for more. I know it isn't the blaring obnoxious music that no one likes. sometimes it even seems like the employees can't stand the facade of this place. Did the owner supply his two donut shops with obscure noise rock compilations for the patrons and employees to be subjected to?

As I pulled up, I was lucky to snag parking space right outside just as someone was leaving. Given how popular this place is, this was probably just a freak miracle. My guess is that usually finding parking there is tough. It's in a slightly dodgy area with more than its fair share of crazy homeless people. But with a downtown location that's par for the course. Some of the best places I've eaten have been in sketchy neighborhoods so that doesn't phase me.

The line was really long. Out the door with ropes set up to zigzag the line back and forth. ""Man"", I thought, ""This place must be absolutely AMAZING!""

My wife and I settled into the back of the line getting ready for a long wait. Surprisingly it wasn't bad at all. The line moved much faster than I expected. That's certainly a big plus.

Once inside I immediately realized why the line was moving quickly. The crew working that day was fantastic. They were laser focused and extremely efficient at moving customers though. The server who helped me was friendly and offered good advice as to which donuts to try. He was also sincerely patient when I took a while to make up my mind.

The donuts themselves look incredible. Goodies pilled high. Definitely an avant garde design sense that pushes the limits of what a donut can be. 

We ordered a large assortment of different types and headed to the picnic benches. Ready to have my taste buds blown.

They weren't.

I tried a bite of each one and frankly I didn't love any of them. Don't get me wrong they are ok. Just not ""the best donut you've ever tasted"" Most of them were way too sweet. Some were too messy to enjoy. Others seemed weird just for the sake of being weird.

They are good, the Memphis Mafia gets solid marks for inventiveness in name and ingredients plus being enough for 2 (or 3 small people). The whole range of cereal toppings has never intrigued me but the other signature items are fun such as the VooDoo itself, or the one that a friend of mines little girl said ""Daddy can I get the one shaped like a 'T', please"" (in reality turn the T upside down and remember it has a cream filling)

What is toughest part of VooDoo is the line to wait in to get one esp after midnight on a weekend. Go there just about any time and you will have a wait of 10 to 20 min but I have to admit to stopping in once because when I drove by there was no line. 

My test of any doughnut shop is the Old Fashioned my standard is with glaze but sometimes go with a chocolate topping. I am not to concerned about what oil is in the fryer as long as its changed on a regular schedule. To get high marks in my book the ""shell"" of the old fashioned should have a crunch to the ridges then a solid inside the teeth can cut with ease without it breaking apart or so tight you have to pull. (Having any heat left from the fryer is an added bonus if found) 

The marks above is my overall impression of the Old Fashioned's I had here, one glaze one chocolate. One had the ridge crunch and both needed to be pulled a bit, flavor of the dough seemed a touch off but that could always be just the batch or oil so will edit next time I go in if something changes.",2014-02-28 07:29:51

The family (Wife, kids, Brother) and I decided to venture into Portland for the afternoon to be ""tourists for a day"".  We opted to hit up both Voodoo and Big-Ass Sandwiches truck which are across the street from each other.

I already knew the line for Voodoo would be an hour or more long and I kept telling the family, no doughnut is worth an hour wait.  I don't care, it's not worth an hour wait.  

It just so happened the wait at Big-Ass was the same today (around 1:00 p.m. arrival) but we split up and luckily received both orders at the same time.  

We sat down at the picnic tables Voodoo offers and other than the homeless guy digging through the trash can eating previously eaten doughnuts, the stay was comfortable.  A nice couple from Indiana joined us, which made for some nice conversation.

I ordered the Maple Bacon Doughnut and the ""Cock N' Balls"".

For those of you who decide Bacon on a doughnut is something you cannot stomach and shouldn't be on doughnuts and verbally make it known on Yelp, I say your palate isn't refined enough to post reviews to begin with.

Also keep in mind, Have you ever had breakfast consisting of Pancakes with Bacon and Eggs?  If so, then why are you against a a Voodoo Bacon Maple Doughnut.  Afterall, doesn't the maple syrup you put on your pancakes, sometimes run over onto your bacon?  Enough said!

I found my Maple Bacon Doughnut to be Heavenly.  This yeast raised doughnut with a sweet maple glaze and two strips of smokey bacon to be perfect.  The doughnut was soft, the glaze not overly sweet and the bacon cooked nicely.  The whole doughnut was creamy and buttery.  I will definitely order this again.  The saltiness and smokiness of the bacon complimented the maple glaze perfectly.  This is a must have if you visit Voodoo.

My ""Cock N' Balls"" err I mean Voodoo's Cock N' Balls doughnut is about the size of two ""log"" doughnuts covered in chocolate and filled with a triple cream filling.  I was too stuffed from the Big-Ass sandwiches (you can find my review on their Yelp page) and the bacon doughnut to dig into this, but I will enjoy it later and will post more.

**Update** Just dug into the Cock N' Balls.  Chewy, Chocolate goodness with triple cream oozing from the sides when your mouth bites down.  I'm not a huge chocolate fan, so curious how this would be with a different frosting, hmmmmmmm.

I didn't try any of their other doughnuts, but future visits will change that.

The only thing keeping me from giving Voodoo 4 or 5 stars is my lack of trying their other doughnuts and the Hour Long Wait.  However I understand they are open 24 hours a day and have another location across the river which is not as busy, so I may venture over to the 3rd Ave location during the Midnight hour and if the lines are short and the other doughnuts are tasty, I will update with 4-5 stars.",2012-08-19 02:49:29

My husband and I drove down from Vancouver, Canada on a long weekend and met another couple that were going down the same time.  We decided to get some donuts on our last night there because we've heard so much about Voodoo.  There was a pretty long line-up outside that went down the block, but decided to wait anyway because we were there anyway.  The line took about 30-40 minutes which is pretty ridiculous to me for donuts, but again, we were with friends and chatting so it didn't feel that long. 

Both couples ended up getting a random dozen to eat and bring back home.  In this random box, you get a dozen (I think) donuts and they make the assortment for you.  They do have a great variety of donuts, but the dough in the donut isn't anything different than, say, a Tim Horton's donut if you're from Canada.

I'd say save your time if the line-up is long, and try it out if the line is short.  It's more of a novelty to take pictures and say you've been.",2014-07-16 18:05:06

I had to remind her to give me my change when she came back. I grabbed my pink box and went back to the car where we would ""see what we got.""

I got what I thought would be the safest choice, a donut with white icing and shimmery purple sprinkles. It was so sweet, I took a few bites then threw the rest away. 

We closed the box up, and the next day the donuts were stale so into the compost they went. 

So, we came, we saw, we won't come back. I stand by my statement that ""no donut is worth this wait."" Personally I like the plain old-fashioned donuts at 7-11 better, and its cleaner there too.",2016-07-26 22:58:58

The donuts were just okay. To be honest, they were better than a supermarket donut but not as good as the donuts I get at my local donut shop so I was somewhat disappointed.

Voodoo has a vibe of young, hip, fun. Fun decor, fun donut names. For the price of one donut at Blue Star (the more sophisticated, elegant donut shop), you can get 2-3 donuts at Voodoo.

If we are talking about the quality, consistency, and flavor of the donut/dough itself (not the toppings or glazes), I think the two shops are pretty comparable.

Up until a few years ago, I would've opted for a pork chop for dessert. And forget about ever having anything sweet for breakfast. Savory all the way, baby.

So now I know why seniors retire, move to Florida, and always have to eat pie for dessert. It's because they're stuck in an old folks home with no visitors, wearing Depends, gumming mashed peas and green Jell-O, and playing Bingo with an old geezer named Gomer. 

Sugar has become their only joy in life.

As this epiphany dawned on me, now I also know why I'm not as choosy with my sweets and why I can actually tolerate waiting in line for a freakin' sugary artery-clogging, muffin top-inducing doughnut (or two) for breakfast. 

It's because of bacon. Yes, the bacon on the glorious Bacon Maple Bar. No longer is it just a sugary doughnut, but now it has become a savory-salty-sweet meal. The savory-salty always cancels out the sweet, and thus we have zero calories and zero guilt (especially when you eat standing up).

a) Don't move to Florida.
b) Don't get old.
c) Don't make friends with an old geezer named Gomer.
d) Always eat standing up.

Blueberry, bubblegum (with bubblegum in wax paper attached), voodoo doll, raspberry filled, Portland creme, plain sugar, tang orange dipped and dusted. Total cost for seven doughnuts? Over $15 dollars. Not to say that's expensive but in comparison to every other doughnut shop from boring to boutique, that's on the high end of price spectrum.

Enjoyed these in the morning with a tall dark coffee with an extra espresso shot. The voodoo was great for novelty, raspberry for blood, the pretzel stick for a dagger through the heart. But the problem is the novelty wears off and you have to actually eat the doughnut sponge bread. That was the problem. Of course, the plain glazed classic is the defacto basic comparison, where the breading is evaluated. It tastes like it should but is dry and waxy, and the texture is like wonder bread that has gone stale. This is where a standard glazed from Krispy Kreme rules over all other doughnuts and the reason it does. 

The best of the bunch was the blueberry, which had a crunchy sugar glazed exterior (like an old fashioned) and a gooey soft interior with blueberries - it looked totally different than the rest of the doughnuts breading. The second best was the Portland creme which is chocolate coated, custard filled, with 2 dots of white frosting. The orange tang with 3 marshmallows on top and gum flavored glazed were strictly novelty and were not eaten after the first tasting bite. The plain glazed was awful and worse in every way than your generic 35 cent local grocery store offering.

CASH ONLY at their shop, keep that in mind. Loud boombox makes it hard to order food but is quite fitting to the eclectic interior, doughnut selection and staff.

I came here around 8pm (Voodoo is 24 hour so you should stop by at off hours), and there was only a line of about 10 people, instead hundreds during the day time. My girlfriend and me ordered 5 doughnuts all together. The ones that were filled with jelly made both of us gag. The filling is so sweet, you are guaranteed to have diabetes after consuming a single doughnut. For the ones that were not filled with jelly, you could more clearly tell that the doughnut dough was not done well. Compared to a place like Blue Star Donuts, you can definitely taste that the doughnut is not fresh, and you get an oily taste in your mouth after each bite. Gross! Unlike Blue Star which convinced me to give doughnut a second chance since I actually hate doughnut, Voodoo reminded me again of why I hated doughnut so much in the first place.

The rude cashier Diana Prince never returned to apologize after such bold statements, another co worker apologized on her behalf but walked away from me before i could say anything... avoid this place your gonna get ripped off!

1. For the people watching
2. To say you've been here and cross it off your travel bucket list

This is a Celiac's worst nightmare, but damn it, sometimes I just want to feel like a normal person and have a damn doughnut. Voodoo's do have the typical traditional doughnut's, but they are truly know for their interesting combinations. 

I would seriously recommend checking out their website prior to going and have an idea of what you want prior to ordering, as this helps speed up the line.

I feel the best/worst time to try and get Voodoo's is right after the bars close. It eerily similar to the Vegas airport taxi line at around midnight. Just substitute the ropes for the pink bike racks that keep the line from over taking the sidewalk. If you happen to go in the daylight and at the right time, you could be serenaded by the one and only uni-cyclist, dressed like Darth Vader, wearing a kilt, and playing the Star Wars theme song on the bag pipes. This is seriously the highlight of waiting in line, because the guy has talent to be able to pull this combination of things off. 

They do offer seating outside if you wish to enjoy your sweets shortly after purchase. Also, if you plan to travel back home with any of Voodoo's goods, plan for this, especially if you are flying out of PDX. It takes extra effort to have the pink box make it on long haul flights.

I'm a Portland native and have never been to a brick-and-mortar Voodoo Doughnut store and I probably never will.  However, today a Voodoo Doughnut mobile truck unit was sitting in Pioneer Courthouse Square, and I decided to stop for a Sunday morning treat.  I was mostly enticed by the fact that there was not much of a line (three girls were just ahead of me) and I could get in and out in a matter of moments.  

I like fairly plain doughnuts (cake doughnuts, buttermilk bars, etc.), so I ordered a buttermilk bar.  You should have seen the looks of amazement on those girls' faces when I didn't order one of the fancy doughnuts.  The buttermilk bar itself was very fresh and light as a feather with a cake-like interior and nicely glazed outside.  I ate it with great appreciation and moved right along to hop on MAX to head for home.

So there you go - my first Voodoo doughnut.  Like I said, it was tasty and very well made, so I give three stars just for that alone.  The counter person in the truck was far from engaging, just took my money and silently handed me back my buttermilk bar, so one star off for customer service.  I'm not impressed by Voodoo Doughnut as a cultural icon for Portland, so one last star off for that, and have trouble believing that people talk about them all over the world, but they sure do.  The Voodoo Doughnut concept would have been truly revolutionary back in the sixties, so to me the funny names and interesting doughnut flavors are sort of old school and give me the feeling ""we've been down this road before.""  I would certainly order a good old-fashioned plain doughnut from them again if I found myself in the same situation (no line and mobile truck), but I think hell is going to freeze over before that happens again.",2012-09-17 00:21:04

Voodoo Doll
Old Dirty Bastard

With all the hype going around this place for years, I decided to finally try out this place. The overall dough was good which was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. Both doughnuts were pretty large too. The Voodoo Doll was a little too much for me. I know it is all just food coloring  on top to decorate the Doll but I felt like it was a little too much. The chocolate frosting was decently smooth though. The other thing that I didn't like is the pretzel because it tasted a little stale. The raspberry filling added to the monstrosity of sweetness. The Old Dirty Bastard is extremely heavy with mouthfuls of Oreos, chocolate frosting, and peanut butter drizzle. Definitely not for the light hearted but tasted really sweet.

After wanting to come here for the past 5 months, my curiosity has finally been fulfilled. Great for the hipster feel but nothing outstanding (taste-wise) caught my attention. Definitely a tourist trap but I don't mind getting trapped every once in a while.

There will be a line around the block at any time of the day.  I've randomly walked by very early in the morning and been able to swing in for a doughnut without having to wait but this is a rarity.  The lines are mostly made up of tourists who were told this was a place you absolutely had to try when in Portland. 

In the end, the doughnuts are nothing special.  They're unique in that they're covered in all kinds of sugary bits you normally don't see on doughnuts.

First of all, you need to be lucky when trying to park your car. After you park, expect to wait because there will be a line outside. I think my group waited about 30 minutes. Once inside you will notice a carousel of doughnuts and a sign that states ""If you choose the doughnuts it will be $$, if I choose for you it will be $"". 

I got a dozen doughnuts to share with my group and I let counter guy choose the doughnuts for me but asked him to throw in some of the things I wanted.  He was kind enough to do so.

We eat the doughnuts once we got to the hotel and the doughnuts are very good. I had the bacon maple bar which was something different. The doughnut by itself was fantastic but when you add the bacon it become something else. Your brain gets thrown off by the saltiness of the bacon against the super sweet maple bar. 

I have to admit that they are imaginative when creating  their doughnuts, they are tasty and very good eats. However, the bottom line is: a doughnut is just a doughnut. It is a sweet bread covered in sweeter frosting, the rest of the toppings can be your heart's desire.

This place offers a good treat, and I like their doughnuts but I think this may have been too hyped up. Waiting to park and waiting on the line is not worth the trouble for creative doughnuts. 

I am giving this place 3 stars for taste and 4 stars creativity. This is a place where you just go to say you've been there. I think this place is a step above a Dunkin Donuts but a step below a Krispy Kreme",2011-07-05 05:24:04

With it's fun doughnut creations, funky decor, and wedding options, Voodoo gets a couple stars for ingenuity alone. Surprisingly, we didn't spend all that long in line, but there was only one employee working the counter and based on her demeanor, I can see that customer service isn't their focus. 

We ordered the Bacon Maple (self explanatory), the Portland Cream (chocolate iced with cream filling), the McMinninville Cream (maple iced with cream filling), and the Old Dirty Bastard (chocolate iced with crumbled Oreos and peanut butter on top). 4 doughnuts cost us about $8, so you obviously pay for the novelty of it all.

Boyfriend thought the Bacon Maple was pretty good and he liked his Portland Cream. I didn't try either of his, but my McMinninville Cream was tasty, but uber sweet to the point where I couldn't finish it all. The ODB was pretty dry, though the flavor combo was a good mix. I again didn't eat the whole thing. These were not the worst doughnuts I've ever had, but not the best either.

Verdict from boyfriend: ""Good. Doughnuts are doughnuts...they're all good.""

Verdict from more discerning me: Overrated for the quality of the product, but certainly fun and creative in terms of the store and ambiance.",2010-08-29 15:06:40

Portland's ""world famous"" donut shop has turned from a quirky doughnutery, to an underwhelming gimmick.  No one who lives in Portland ever eats here, but who cares?  Tourists flock to this place to fulfill their food network/travel magazine fantasies.  

I could get mad at the big VD for feeding this madness, but who can blame them?  Why make cheap, delicious donuts, readily available for locals, when you could make buku bucks off of snaking lines of tourists? 

VooDoo I'm not exactly mad, I understand why you do it, I am just disappointed.  You feel like Redbull to me. Their drink tastes horrible, but they are widely popular due to their marketing. You are not buying a canned energy drink, you are buying a piece of their global brand.  Voodoo has grown to the point where most everyone will go bonkers over anything that is in one of their pink boxes, and I believe that is a dangerous notion.  

I fear that other Portland staples (we're looking at you Pok Pok!) will follow the Voodoo Model of selling out, growing complacent and catering to the first time tourists who are so excited to instagram their food that they can only taste the hype, not the actual flavors.   

Voodoo, if one night stands with droves of tourists with poor pallets is what will put your kids to college, I begrudgingly will allow you to carry on.

We made the two hour drive down from Olympia in the pouring rain. We arrived pretty early on Saturday and found that the line was already wrapped around the outside of the building. Obviously, in this part of the country you can't let standing in the rain for 30 minutes stop you. 

We used our line time to scan the menu online and choose our flavors. The longer we waited the larger our wish list grew. We settled on a dozen donuts for the two of us.

The Maple Bar was the best donut of the bunch. The Grape Ape and Mango Tango were good too. I liked the sugar crunch and the flavor of the powders with the icing and donut. Everything with cereal on top was a disappointment since all of the cereal tasted stale. Cereal on top of the donut sounds interesting, but just doesn't work.

Keep in mind that they only accept cash so make sure to hit the ATM before visiting. I want to say that there was an ATM on site, but I wouldn't count on that.

Service is terrible and the doughnuts didn't look fresh. I ordered a Voodoo dozen and the lady went to the back and just grabbed a box from who knows how long ago?

I also ordered the bacon maple ($2.50) which was overly sweet and the voodoo man which was okay at best. All in all I do NOT recommend unless you want to become a diabetic. The line, the service, the food, and the space were all below expectations.

The Old Dirty Bastard was less desirable. Nobody likes stale oreos, and there was WAY too much frosting even for a sugar addict like myself. I ate a couple bites and threw it away. Same issue with the Mango Tango- jelly filling was sweet enough without all that frosting. 

The employees are upbeat and friendly despite having to deal with a high volume of indecisive tourists and obnoxious drunkards. Props. 

My hometown team, the Houston Rockets, happened to be playing the Portland Trailblazers that night. They displayed a Texas-sized donut and encouraged customers to place a hex on the Rockets. I guess it worked. We lost. Heartbreaking.",2014-05-13 15:06:09

When we were just on vacation in Portland I waited in their long line for a half an hour just to get up to the front and realize that they only accept cash. Who even carries cash nowadays? Anyways, the curiosity got the best of me so the next day my wife and I decided to go there to finally find out what the hype was all about, again, the lines at their downtown location were too long so we decided to go to their Northeast Portland location. The line was not much better there but went by fairly fast. Luckily I had cash in hand this time since this location is cash only as well. We started by trying to order their most famous doughnut and they were all out, the doughnut with the most hype, because of its shape, they were all out of. So we started going down the list and every other doughnut we tried to order they were out of as well.

We basically ended up getting any flavor at this point and the doughnuts did NOT match all the hype. Isn't a super hyped doughnut place at least supposed to serve warm, or at least fresh doughnuts? Well these weren't. They were completely average tasting, another review I read was accurate when it said that they tasted like Safeway doughnuts. We didn't even get ours in a box and the one we took home for our daughter that was shaped like a doll was put at the bottom of a bag beneath the other doughnuts and was all smashed up.

I was a little overwhelmed by the plethora of donuts sitting on the rotating carousel. So many - cake, old-fashioned, speciality, where do I begin?

We decided to try the chocolate cream donut, maple old-fashioned, double chocolate cake, red blaming blunt, and blueberry cake donut. We should have just gotten one - the  Blueberry donut. It was sweet and tasty. We just took a few bites of the other donuts - they weren't worth the calories. The maple and double chocolate cake were both a bit dry. I like the bavarian cream in the chocolate cream donut, but it was nothing special. The red blaming donut is nothing more than a cinnamon donut with some sprinkles. The donuts are a notch above Dunkin' Donuts. The locals go to Blue Star - I can see why. 

The donuts aren't worth the wait. Luckily, the line wasn't too long when i was there at 10pm on Sunday. It's much longer during the day and in the evening. While waiting in line, be careful! The donut shop is in a shady area and plagued with homeless people. This guy came right up to my boyfriend in the parking lot and scared us as we were walking towards the donut shop. The parking lot across the street is very expensive, I recommend street parking a block away. No better way to wait in line than people asking you for money! It was so bad that we didn't even bother to sit down and nibbled on the donuts when we got to the car.

The line was incredibly long and it was a hot day, so it was really frustrating to see that if they were having great business, they should of expanded. But, hearing all the great things about Voodoo donuts and from the commercials on T.V., we decided it was well worth the wait. 

By the time we get into the store, the store is small and looks  very ghetto. We finally got our turn to order and we decided on getting a dozen of the voodoo donuts and 6 personal donuts we ordered. 

Some of the donuts weren't even unique in its entirety. I mean, come on, Captain Crunch on donuts? The only thing I was impressed with was the Voodoo man. It had some creativity in it's shape, but still was overly saturated with sugar. The sugar in these donuts were overwhelming and very difficult to eat. 

I also tried one of their Cruellers since they are my favorite type of donuts. Unfortunately, I had one with frosting and 2 marshmallows on top. It wasn't what I expected.

On the other hand, candor and good taste compel me to say that I am simply not capable of recommending Voo-Doo to anyone on the basis of their actual product. As that great American patriot Don King might say, ""Only in America"" could you see huge success and financial windfall, simply from pouring stale cereal, bacon, and plastic army soldiers, etc, etc, on top of a quality of dough-nut that make Albertson's deli/bakery seem genius by comparison. The axiom widely attributed to H. L. Mencken  is completely applicable here: No one EVER went broke, under-estimating the intelligence of the American public....


My rating is not based on any particular negative experiences, per se..... most of my exposure to Voo-Doo is owing to dastardly cretins in the workplace, who insist on bringing those incriminating pink boxes, chock full o' Voo-Doo doo-doo in for yet another round of group self-sabotage. Admittedly, one almost cannot help but get a certain, twisted satisfaction from watching certain work-mates (and this type exists in almost every work place, you may be very sure) complain gratuitously at the first sight of the donuts--It is herein requested that these beasties be more properly called ""do-nots""--- only to inevitably behold the same co-workers shortly thereafter set upon said ""do-nots"" and cram them into their seldom-closed pie holes w/an alacrity suggesting the long dreaded Apocalypse, w/the attendant looting, rioting, and mass starvation is imminently at hand. 


This rating is most assuredly not simple-minded contrarianism nor envy of the afore-mentioned success.... in fact, I wish the fine folks @ Voo-Doo ongoing, delirious levels of success. As long as nit-wit tourists are willing to continue lining the sidewalks waiting to fill their coffers for something as mundane as Voo-Doo donuts, there is hope, gentle reader, for you and I, likewise. Perhaps we might even join forces to create and attract more intergalactic nit-wits w/our very own trendy product(s), served up of course by only the smuggest and most pretentious of world-famous Portland-brand Hipsters (patent pending).

As for voodoo, they have a couple of locations and you will generally stand in line for a while, maybe an hour or more. Having grownup in Los Angeles, we have some local donut shops that have long lines, such as Randy's near LAX or Donutman in Glendora.
Now, back to voodoo.... they have weird donuts... weird flavors, weird shapes, weird colors.. which doesn't mean a bad thing, but unfortunately, they were more hype than anything. They are not cheap, expect to get a half dozen donuts and spend about 15 dollars or more. Other problem, they aren't really great.. some are actually not really good either. Last problem, both my wife and I noticed a touch of heartburn after eating them....Not normal for me, as I've been known to each a few donuts in a few minutes with no regret. My suggesting is just find a  good ol mom and pop donut place and give them your business. Enough with hipster places that don't live up to the hype.",2018-07-30 00:14:55

It is a tourist trap! And I fell for it. I have seen Voodoo Doughnuts everywhere, from the food network and the travel channel and food blogs. I have always wanted to visit and try their donuts for as long as I can remember. The premise and unique donuts were just enticing. I was excited and hyped to finally try it after years and years of seeing it. However, it is just the biggest disappointment ever. 

We went on a Friday afternoon and the line was just inside. Thank goodness there was not a long line because I would have been even more upset for standing in line for this. It is cash only and there's an ATM before reaching the counter to select your donuts. The menu was tough to read and I had no idea what was going on. It was not cohesive at all and too much going on. So I had to rely on the spinning case of donuts to see which one we would get. Once we got to the counter, the employees were rushing us to select donuts. I get that they're trying to get the line moving, but a) there wasn't even a line and b) we have no idea what to get because of the hot mess of a store it is. We eventually got the fruit loops donut and the coconut with guava filling. 

The donuts are not good at all. At all. The fruit loop donuts was unnecessarily massive. The donut itself was alright. The frosting was disgusting and too sweet. Frosting should not be put on donuts. It wasn't even good quality frosting. It was a bit runny and too thin. The fruit loops were stale and hard and didn't even taste like fruit loops. We only ate like 25% of it. The coconut guava was not as bad, but still not good. Again, frosting should not be put on donuts. There was way too much frosting on this one and had to scrape it off. The guava filling was good, but it tasted artificial. 

I understand that this is a novelty item and a touristy thing. But it was just awful and disgusting. The hype surrounding it makes it even worse. I didn't even take pictures because it wasn't worth it. I'm extremely disappointed. If there's a line, don't bother. You can try it still, but don't expect anything good.",2018-08-17 16:32:23

The line from the outside was ridiculous as it went out the door and hugged the side of the building. This doughnut shop is located in a very active and electric part of downtown where people are out and about, friends hanging out and families/tourists are grabbing doughnuts for the night. 

We got in line and waited for about 20 minutes or so. Once at the cash register, we ordered a box of doughnuts. I kept my eyes on the blueberry cake doughnut (although  I should have just went with the old fashioned cake doughnut now that I think about it). I like blueberries though and I've had blueberry doughnuts so I thought this would be good too. The doughnuts were cheap. Good prices. Service was okay. The donut shop is quite eclectic in decor and ""in-your-face"" with doughnuts. Some were decorated with cereal (I don't care for) and others were plain like chocolate frosting or sprinkles. There was a really large doughnut too. I didn't get to eat my doughnut until the morning because we were just all too tired once we got to the place we were staying.

Then next day, I tried my doughnut. It was alright. The other blueberry doughnut I've had at another place did it better in terms of flavor. I mean keeping it in it's box couldn't have changed the flavor much, right? It was cake-y, soft in the middle and had a blueberry flavor. Tasted really artificial though. Unfortunately it was the only doughnut I tried from Voodoo but at the point I wasn't really craving doughnuts or really sweet things anymore.

+The ""Blood filled"" doughnut was tasty
+Lots of fun/unique doughnuts to try
+Open 24hours (except on Sundays)
+Inexpensive

-The location is a little small and cramped
-Not the best area to visit late at night

This was a fun place to visit and you can't really go wrong stopping here for a late night dessert. If you are lucky you might see someone take up their challenge in which you must devour a huge doughnut in like 80 seconds. If you accomplish this feat, the doughnut is gratis!

I should add that while this is a fun place to visit, don't expect gourmet doughnuts, this isn't that type of place. It's really just a place where they sort of experiment with different toppings. For instance the Maple bacon is just a maple doughnut with a strip or two of bacon on it. I had a bite and it was tasty enough, but not what I'd call imaginative. On the other hand, I purchased the ""Blood filled"" and really liked it. It was sort of a chocolatey doughnut with a small pretzel and raspberry filling, good stuff!",2009-01-08 04:22:57

Adam Richman glorified this place for the donuts and it seems that because of this everyone says that you have to go. Plus it seems like Voodoo Donuts is like Cocaine to people in Portland. I carried that well-known pink box into the shopping mall and eveyone's head turns in jealousy. Employees ask if they can hold your box while you shop. They just want a whiff or even a taste.

When we got there in the afternoon the line wasn't long, but it was extremely hot outside and even with air condiitoning in the building, you can feel everyone's body heat. When we get to the counter we order a ton of stuff:

The Voodoo Doughnut - donut covered in chocolate and filled with raspberry jelly. Shaped like a person and stabbed in the heart with a pretzel. Has the VD initials on it, though I think that shouldn't be there cuz VD stands for something else in the health field. 

The Peach fritter: Peach fritter covered with a white (cream cheese?) icing and sprinkles. 

The bavarian creme: Donut stuffed with bavarian creme and topped with maple icing.

The raspberry donut: Donut with raspberry filling and lightly glazed

The Old Dirty Bastard: Chocolate Donut with Peanut Butter and Cookie Crumbles

The Maple BAcon Donut: Donut topped with Maple Bacon Icing and Bacon. 

The Mango Tango: Donut filled with Mango Jelly and topped with white icing and sprinled wiht Orange Tang.

The only donut that I liked was the Maple Bacon Donut. What I like about VooDoo Donuts is that the Donut itself is not laden with sugar. It is perfectly cooked and it isn't dry or too sweet. There also isn't this residual fat taste that you get in your mouth after you eat a donut. The icing on all of the VooDoo donuts are all very sweet and in my opinion intolerable. That's why the saltiness of the bacon counterbalances the super sweetness of the icing. I think that I would have liked the other donuts had the icing been not prepared too sweet. 

I think everyone should come here at least once to try the donut and see the huge array of designs. Otherwise, I probably won't return. I'd like to spare my teeth the cavities.",2011-07-11 19:08:09

The wait during peak times can be in the hours. And for what? If they were the most amazing donuts I'd ever had then I'd forgive the wait. If they were even mildly great I could make an argument. But no. The donuts are barely average. Yes, they have original toppings (is maple and bacon even original anymore?), but the donuts themselves are average. Maybe even below average. They're not fluffy, they're too sweet, and worst of all they're stale. With their volume, each batch should be hot and fresh, but instead they feel like the leftovers from yesterday. The best donut we tried was the Captain Crunch, and that's simply because adding Captain Crunch makes desserts taste better. Don't believe me? Throw some on your frozen yogurt next time and I'll accept your apology via Twitter or Instagram.

When you hear about Portland, you often hear about Powell's bookstore, The Rose Garden, and especially Voodoo Donuts. Voodoo Doughnuts is Portland's biggest and most popular doughnut shop. Being so famous, I knew I had to visit it at least once. There are several Voodoo Doughnut locations but I visited the main Voodoo Doughnut location near Old Town/ChinaTown.

My friend and I visited Voodoo's at around 10:17am and boy was the line long. The sheer amount of people waiting for the line was so long, it could even rival Disneyland lines!

We ended up waiting around an hour until we got to the register. There is a giant menu outside the store and a variety of donuts inside, but I had my game plan for doughnuts ready. One thing that I really loved was the sheer amount of creativity and uniqueness 

My friend and I ordered:
Old Dirty Bastard (Oreos & Peanut Butter), Fruit Loops Doughnut, Voodoo Doughnut (A Chocolate Donut with frosting made to look like a Voodoo Doll and jam filling with a pretzel stick in the middle), and Maple Bacon. And a nice refreshing carton of milk to go with all the awesome donuts.

The Old Dirty Bastard was personally too much for me since I don't enjoy peanut butter. My friend who really likes peanut butter thought that this donut was good but not amazing.
The Fruit Loops Doughnut was so disappointing. The fruit loops on top were stale, and the doughnut itself was sort of plain.
The Voodoo Doughnut was arguably the best doughnut out of my box. The jam inside was a nice addition to the doughnut, and the shape of the doughnut made it fun to eat! I'm also just a giant fan of chocolate doughnuts.
Last but not least, the Maple Bacon. The Maple Bacon is a maple syrup with bacon doughnut. A sweet and salty experience. I personally thought the doughnut itself was good, but the bacon on top was too inconvenient to eat. It was just a giant piece of cold bacon that wouldn't break into pieces easily.

Overall, Voodoo Doughnut is Portland's most famous doughnut store. I think Voodoo's is easily the most unique and creative doughnut place around, but in terms of quality and time I spent waiting in line for these doughnuts, makes this place a visit once and done.",2017-07-11 18:38:32

Passing through Portland had limited time for culinary experiences. Voodoo Donuts was for shir an experience. We went at 6pm on a Monday and had zero line. 

Pros: hip; parking; decor; vegan options; display for vegan options; Apple vegan fritter; creative use of cereal toppings; awesome pink boxes 

Cons: lack of restroom; cash only; adult humor [both my kids bought ""cock and balls donuts"" was horrified that they were also cream filled]; lack donut descriptions on menu; donuts just okay 

We told the kids for being good for the 5 hours drive to Portland they could each pick 1 donut, anything. They have donuts that are like two chocolate bar donuts making a 'T' but because of fluffy roundness the resemblance is closer male anatomy so the name is apt. In the spinning clear displays there are decorated donuts with words & art. The cost of these huge donuts because of decor is $7.50 each. And as aforementioned there is no description of items so I was surprised to find these donuts, the cock and balls donuts are filled with white cream. 

I ate a vegan apple fritter. Most Fritters are not vegan and it didn't rock my world but it was a good vegan donut for shir. Plus it was only 2 bucks. 

Hubs had a voodoo donut & blueberry flavor. His donuts were $5 bucks combined. 

5 donuts & 4 people total= $22

Anyway, this place does have insanely novel donuts, all cuckoo and crazy and lots of fun. Yet, unless I was a tourist, I would not be okay with standing in line for an upwards of 2-hour wait. There's something very... un-natural (and un-Voodooey) about that. 

I've really only been here 2 times, both of which were with family from out of town. The other times I was really hungry (and the hours were so weird that there really wasn't much of a line).

Captain, My Captain - The dough was nothing out of the ordinary. I picked this one because I thought it was going to be good with captain crunch but to my disappointment, it was extremely sweet with the cream that held the captain crunch to the doughnuts. Also, the captain crunch was stale!!

Voodoo Doll - This was definitely better than Captain, My Captain. I really enjoy the jelly inside. Although the cream on top was still a bit sweet. The creation of the character is pretty cute.

Good: This was the first place I ever had bacon on a maple bar. It was novel and gorgeous this first time that shock of maple sweetness met the salty smoke of cured pork belly in my oral cavity. It's been done to death since then. I could probably write a decent academic piece that strongly correlated the ""bacon on EVERYTHING!!!"" movement with this place, but I'll take up that work another day. For this day, this doughnut is unmitigated good. 

Good: last time I checked, you could still get a bucket of older doughnuts from the night before in a 5 gallon bucket for like $10. The first time I tried this I was a minor hero when I showed up to the office with a bucket of goodies that was sorta commingled, sorta smashed in places, and sort of like a food-grade garage can (in a good way).  If they still do this and you have lots of hungry folks, get this. If they don't do this anymore, then join me for a moment of silence for the joys of the past deals no longer with us. Amen. 

Bad: Cereals on doughnuts is a gimmick that results in a fine doughnut with stale old crap all over it.  I see what the idea is. It doesn't work unless you throw some of Clark W. Griswold's high gloss cereal varnish on there. That doesn't really exist. Neither does a good cereal doughnut. Stop. 

Bad: cash only. It's not 1985. 

Good: The Old Dirty Bastard.

Honestly, I don't think this place deserves the accolades or the hate it gets. It makes good doughnuts, bad doughnuts, and some are in between doughnuts.

Have fun picking out fun flavors, but don't expect a great culinary experience.

Since they're so heavy, they're much better when they're (relatively) fresh, so if you take a box to another city for your friends, by the time they eat some, they'll probably think you're crazy for dragging those donuts around the US. Maybe you can just eat the whole box for yourself while traveling.

As others have mentioned, I'm not sure how fairly average doughnut shop has managed to become associated with the very fabric of Portland's being just by throwing some glitter on the wall and selling over-sized boxes.

They have one infamous cream doughnut that looks like a dong, but I think they missed the boat for that being shocking by a good 15-20 years. I'm pretty sure there are erotic bakeries in Chelsea (Manhattan in New York City for the West-Coast lifers) that have reached the point of willing to depict full hardcore pornography on an apple strudel if that's what you want...

Speaking of hard numbers: I waited 40 minutes in line to spend 28 dollars on 13 doughnuts.

Spoiler Alert: it's not worth it.

Are the doughnuts bad? I wouldn't go that far. If you gave VDD one star for quality I'd love to read your reviews of a Dunkin Donuts. 

On the other hand, were they great? Not really. Definitely not good enough to go there regularly and deal with the winding line of tourists / adult-onset diabetes.

I do applaud them for being one of the only truly 24-hour businesses in PDX (maybe you can actually avoid the line at 2am?), but at the same time I boo at them for running a cash-only business. Seriously? You're crumbling up an Oreo onto a doughnut (God Bless America) for a 250% markup and I can't earn some frequent flier miles by swiping the plastic? 

You could say it would make the line worse, but no, what makes the line worse is people fumbling at the ATM who can't believe VDD has the same payment requirements as Lucky Devil Lounge. I guess to be fair, both are similar in that you'd be ashamed for your significant other to see the withdrawl statement if you'd gone without them...

At the end of the day though, the most shocking thing about VDD is the blandness. There's nothing magical, nothing that defines Portland, just OK doughnuts sprinkled with an amazing amount of hype and marketing.

After waiting 45 minutes, we were greeted by a person who didn't know what donuts came in the ""favorite dozen"" pack even though the picture and the donuts were at the front of the register.    She then proceeded to pull out donuts after touching the prior person's money.   She handled our money, and then went to pull more donuts.    It is amazing they have passed health inspections.   The counter and display cases were filthy - inside and out and the back room had three or 4 employees just standing around.   

The donuts were stale - from the cereal crusted topped ones to the buttermilk bar we purchased as an additional donut.    We tried a bit of all the dozen, with none really standing out as exceptional.    I think the donuts at our local Safeway are better - and they are substandard at best.",2011-08-08 02:06:28

Portland Cream.  Official donut of Portland and they make a donation for each sold.  Done deal.  I like the Portland rose icing décor.  Not a real fan of cream filled(or filled donuts for that matter).  Nice donut with creamy center and chocolate icing to balance the filling.

Sadly, I don't think I will return.  I've had many a great donut here in the LA area at local Mom&Pop donut shops usually run by super nice Cambodian families.",2015-07-21 21:04:56

It reminds me a lot of the cupcake craze in DC, people waiting in 40 person deep lines for mediocrity.  

Ther service and the prices were actually not that bad but they are cash only, fyi.  I also like that they sell cartons of milk.

Sure you could wait in a long line for a doughnut, sure you could then overpay (CASH ONLY) for that pastry and sure then you could tell your friends when you were in Portland, you got Cheetos on a doughnut.
It's a pretty sad state too as I don't usually care about the food quality, but since the service is non existent, the food is all there is to comment on and at the very best, it stinks. 
Save your time, save your money, go to Freddies and buy a pack, then lie to all your friends.

Guava toasted coconut - raised donut with guava filling and frosting topped with toasted coconut. Nice to see something different.
Pink lemonade - not special at all. Regular lemon filing.
Lemon chiffon crueller - light and fluffy but the bottom was a bit hard/stale

They're constantly making donuts, too, and put the fresh ones down on the bottom, serving the oldest ones first. Unless you're ready to push for a fresh donut, which can be hard too if you're getting one of their more odd specialty flavors, you're likely to get one that's cold.

It was close to the hotel and there's something about a line of people waiting that suggests something good is going on.
What made the wait particularly vexing was that it wasn't slow service inside, it was customers too busy taking pictures and jack-assing around instead of reading the menu and realizing they only take cash.  Countless people made it to the counter only to be turned away with their credit card.
The interior is kind of fun, there is a giant, ugly donut and they were playing death metal.  The employees are definitely part of Portland's hipster elite.
As for the donuts themselves, the very item behind all the waiting and silliness?  They were simply okay.  I had a plain raised with chocolate that was the definition of 'A-OK', and then I told the guy to surprise me and got 'The Ol Dirty Bastard', which is a raised donut with peanut butter and smashed oreos on top.

The place is open 24 hours, and its cash only.  It's in the sketchy part of town, near Chinatown, and there's a lot of pan handlers and homeless looking people begging for money.  We found parking off the street behind Dante's pizza, and also found the line to get into Voodoo.

The line didn't take that long... I'm estimating 20 minutes.  The store had 4 people working the counter.  Since it was cash only, some customers had to get out of line to use the ATM machine located by the door. There's also plenty of ATM's located on the same block of the store should that machine run out.

We didn't get that many doughnuts... just 5. We got the Portland Cream Doughnut (the official doughnut of the city) as well as the Voodoo Doughnut, an Apple Fritter, a Chocolate glazed, and Stephen's favorite, the Buttermilk Bar.. setting me back $9.00.

Folks - it was just a maple bar with a skinny crusty-ass piece of stale-dry bacon strip laid on the top.  I've never experienced buyers remorse from a doughnut shop so thanks Voodoo!

I think the challenge is that to keep up with the volume, they make these doughnuts two days ahead of time, so when it finally reaches you, it is dry, stale and uninteresting.  I gave an untouched doughnut to a bum nearby and I even saw HIM give it to somebody else.  No joke.

The wait, in spite of the huge line, was maybe 20 minutes. No big.

For people complaining about the price, I think they don't recognize that you're not coming here to buy your standard plain dozen for your family visiting from out of town- you're ordering a specialty breakfast, so no, a dozen donuts will not be 10 bucks.

One caveat- just as we stepped up to greet the cashier, a woman from outside shoves through the line to ask the cashier ""a quick question"". She steps in front of us and spends, literally, 5 solid minutes asking him questions that sum up to the greater inquiry of ""how do I not have to wait in line in the future"". He was very polite to her, and very apologetic to us after she left, but once it became clear she wasn't just asking for a napkin or something, I would preferred if he'd been a little more forthright and asked her to stand aside while he helped people in line, or asked another staffer behind him to assist her. He was a nice kid though, not a huge deal.

And, of course, the donuts. They were quite tasty (bacon maple, blueberry cake, lemon creuller, some over-the-top peanut butter chocolate syrup explosion), but nothing I felt compelled to eat..

But my second work trip there this last month I went on a Monday night, saw no lines and had to hop in. We got the No Name (raised donut with chocolate and peanut butter frosting and rice krispies) & Memphis Mafia (fried donut, banana chunks, glazed with chocolate frosting, peanut butter, nuts and chocolate chips). As you can imagine, it was sugar overload! My 5 year old self would have thought these donuts were God's gift to the world but my adult self just couldn't get into it. There was just too much sweetness going on especially in the Mafia donut -  I mean it's a glazed fritter with more frosted sugar all over it - my taste buds went numb processing all the different levels of sugar.

Plus, the donut itself was very thick - I tend to like more airy, lighter donuts (so I can cheat myself into thinking it wasn't THAT bad....).

All in all, this is clearly a Portland institution and it's one of those ""Gotta try it once.""

Taste-wise it was mediocre at best! Nothing special about the dough or the icing/filling/topping. Ok so they're creative with their flavors, I'll give them that.

The pink sign was very bright and visible, stands out from other shop around the area. The donut shop is located at downtown Portland, area around the shop looks very sketchy, dirty street and many pan handlers wondering around the shop, I am not sure how safe is the area. 

We waited about 25 minutes to get inside the shop to order, got a dozen donuts including cock n balls, captain my captain, old dirty bastard, bacon maple bar, aren't that a peach, voodoo doll, tex-ass, all the special naming donuts that you can get on their menu...etc

Packed in huge pink box with voodoo donut logo. Open the magic voodoo box, and the donuts were huge! Especially the balls on the cock n ball donut, Lol!

The decorative donut designs were so interesting, I had to push myself on taking a bite. What I taste in most of the donuts is SUGAR OVERLOAD, they are extremely sweet, sweet oozing out from the inside (jam filling donuts), sweet frosting cover on the outside with extra sweet sprinkles and drizzles. I think I was going on a sugar high after a few bite, and down them with water. I enjoy the peach filling donut, old dirty bastard and maple bacon bar. The dough were soft, and sweetness melts with it. 

If yelp has 0.50 rating increments, I gave this place a 3.5. The hype magic was there for a short time, then  it disappears. The attraction is for the shape and design of the donuts, and for its naming logistics. The donuts tasted good, but way to sweet for me.",2015-09-05 04:42:56

It looks like exactly what it sounds like:  a maple doughnut with crispy bacon strips on top.  A nice, warm caramel colored icing with 2 strips of fatty bacon laid out nonchalantly on either end of the doughnut.  Like someone just left it there and forgot it.

Sure enough, it also tasted exactly like what it sounds like:  sweet and salty, soft and crunchy.

I wasn't sure whether to expect fireworks coming out of my mouth or to be utterly grossed out.  I liked it, but I didn't love it.  Maybe the bacon looked a little stale, or maybe because the guilt factor in my brain wouldn't let me finish it.  But I had it and I survived!  My friend and I also had the Mexican hot chocolate flavored doughnut, which had a nice rich and spicy flavor.  

Voo Doo is a tiny doughnut shop that flaunts its attitude & sexual brazenness, whether it be from the penis shaped doughnuts to names like ""cock and balls.""

It's a Portland thing. They have a pretty awesome selection of unique doughnuts like the maple bacon bar (not so unique but delicious), fruit loops, cap'n crunch, mango tango, Memphis mafia... I could go on... but the quality isn't consistent. Sometimes the doughnuts are stale, other times they're a real treat; it really depends on the time you go. There are vegan options for those vegans out there who once read or heard somewhere that they should be vegan, so that's a plus for them.

From time to time, the staff can be extremely rude. I get that the employees put up with a lot of crap, but customer service should never harm your business or offend people. The lines on a Friday or Saturday night are terrible and the customer service declines even more.

In reality, this place is a lot of hype with some really unique doughnut selections. It's a tourist attraction. Why wouldn't it be? They have a penis shaped doughnut.

They're fun. They're creative. The staff are sweet, smiling folks who seem to have a great time at work.

It just makes it a gimmick. 

They get a half-star each for the individual categories of: fun, hip, edgy, adorable. 

They get minus-three stars, however, for nothing-special flavor, just 'meh' texture, overuse of sugary glaze (there is such a thing as too much, even on a doughnut) when we're talking about ""food."" Donuts aren't car dashboard decorations (though these could do the job). They're still food. Dessert food. Why can't they be car dashboard decorations =AND= be over-the-top delicious? They are better than, say, the abomination of Krispy Kreme, or Dunkin', or even Annie's, but not nearly as good as, say, Blue Star or Pip's.

They have several locations throughout Oregon as well as a few others around the US. Given that we've visited their stores in LA and Denver, it was time to visit their original location. 

Voodoo Doughnuts is located in the heart of downtown Portland, Oregon. Parking is available on the streets, local parking garages, or in pay for the day lots. You'll notice a line outside of the store with pink metal barriers set up to guide people inside. It's a small shop so only a small number of people can be inside at one time. Also, the entrance and exit doors are adjacent to each other and so people often experience difficulties when trying to leave the store. The exit is usually blocked by people who are standing in line and employees are not that great at keeping that doorway clear.

When we made our way inside, we saw all of the familiar items on the menu. They were all visually appealing with all kinds of creative toppings and ingredients. I love how this location has a bit more than their LA shop because you could see the full range of what they really have.

When it was time to order, I honed In on my favorite doughnut, bubblegum! The sprinkles taste just like bubblegum and it comes with a piece of gum placed in the center of the doughnut. Now Voodoo is famous for their C&B doughnut that is shaped like the lower region of the male anatomy. Being an elementary school teacher, I will not state the actual name of  the doughnut but the abbreviation should give you a big hint as to what it's actually called.

Anyway, as my husband placed his order for two C&B doughnuts, they told us that they ran out of them. They said that they only had the vegan  version of this dessert. So when they went to get the doughnuts from the back, they came back and said that they only have one vegan C&B left. Since we wanted two C&B doughnuts, they said that they could sell us the other one that was revolving around in the glass display case. I asked if it was fresh and they said, ""Not really, but we'll give it to you for free."" We  were cool with that because we ended up with one vegan doughnut and the other one that had been on display for a bit. I can't attest for how the C&B tasted because we picked them up for family members who live in the area.

In general, I absolutely love the creativity behind this establishment. They are definitely ahead of the game when it comes to marketing. Their line always stretches out the door and it's because of customer loyalty and the novelty of this place.

Sure, there was a rotating case of the selections, but no signs on the rotating sweet doughs to let me know what I was looking at.  Grrr.

I ended up with an Old Dirty Bastard, Captain My Captain, and Grape Ape. Finally. Donuts were in hand and a cheer erupted from the line as I exited the rabbit hole.

I gotta say though. The donuts were pretty tasty. Nice doughy chew. Sweet, but come on, it's a cake covered in stuff like Oreos, Cap'n Crunch, Peanut Butter, and grape sugar. Expect sweet, people!

At first, when I saw the banner outside and peeked at the inside of the store, it looked to me rather unappealing. But my girlfriend (being a fan of food shows on TV) suddenly remembered having seen this place featured on TV as a must try, so we decided to give it a try.

For the amount of time on the lineup and all the fuss people seemed to be doing about this place, I was expecting to try the best doughnut I have ever had in my whole life. When we finally reached the inside of the store (which can probably fit no more than 12 people at best at a time), we were greeted by a menu that listed funny names of their doughnuts, but absolutely no description of what each of them is - as if we were expected to know what a ""dirty bastard"" doughnut or contains. 

The service was not a strong point of this shop. The staff at the counter was not extremely helpful. The guy at the counter had an indifferent business-as-usual like attitude towards us, and he provided little to no answer to our questions. We ended up getting the voodoo doll (human shaped donut topped with chocolate and filled with strawberry jam), a donut topped with Oreo and peanut butter, and a glazed donut with sprinkles on top.

The donuts were big in size and visually interesting, but the taste and quality of the product was about average. We found them comparable to donuts available at any Safeway or Tim Hortons: Acceptable, but far from memorable.

hate giving negative reviews but jeez louise - VD has huge, sloppy donuts that I wish were tasteless. Instead, they were just bad.

I used to think bacon - like vicodin - makes everything tasty. Wrong!!!

Boyfriend got some lavender purple monstrosity that tasted like one big mushy bastard cousin to the sweet tart. and we like sweet tarts.

Besides the Waste of Bacon, I also got a plain old cruller. How do you mess up a cruller???? That's a basic!! Its like effing up a stick figure!!

And despite the gross taste (boyfriend who NEVER throws out food, tossed his pastry out after 2 bites), the donuts look like whoever baked it, didn't give a shit about what it looked like.

The fact that it's in an area widely considered Portland's a---; uh - 'armpit' is more than a bit off-putting.  If you can get past the legions of homeless and druggies which frequent this part of town, you'll find this an oasis-of-sorts for sugary treats.

Warning:   If you get there anytime later than opening time on a weekend, or anytime during tourist-season, count on a L-O-N-G line.   You'll be like water-buffalo on the Serengeti; easy targets for panhandlers.   Mainly, they'll take 'no' for an answer.   Sometimes not.   That's why you're glad Portland has bicycle-cops cruising the area.

Inside, another disappointment - they don't take plastic, of any sort.  They are probably the last eatery in Portland not to do so (even the food-carts which have sprung up all over Portland like mushrooms after a fall rain take credit cards), so please be prepared with plenty of cash - another disquieting thing, because the ne'er-do-wells in this area likely know that, also.

You'll be greeted by someone who wants your order, now, and who wants to sell you trinkets - t-shirts and other baubles as 'souvenirs of your visit to Voodoo' - it turns out that the management actually assigns a sales quota to the counter-staff, and if they don't meet it, there are dozens of applications from recent college grads looking to pay down their student-loans.

My most recent stay in Portland I got to stay in Downtown .. so we walked to a lot of places .. including Ground Kontrol on a Sunday .. unlimited free play yes please .. anyways on our way there we noticed Voodoo was still open and there was no line (btw they're open 24 .. didn't know that) .. so upon our return at 1 or 2am we bought a box of random popular picks by the lady at the counter.. who looks like she hates her job b/c she gets asked by so many people for recommendations im sure .. but sorry I can't tell what the donuts are just by looking. 

The only donut I actually enjoyed was the oreo peanut butter one .. idk what it's called .. they have difficult names. I'm glad I was finally able to try it .. but I would've been pretty sad/upset if I had to wait in a long line just to try these donuts. I'd recommend going late at night .. after midnight.

Of course with great things, there is always a line.  The line wasn't too bad for us, maybe 20-30 mins?  Dropped my friend off and I went to look for parking.  Parking is cray cray, so park near Chinatown or something.  We went on a Sunday, so parking was free till 1pm.  Do give yourself time though, you never know!

Oh before I forget CASH ONLY!!!!

We freaked out because we totally forgot about it, but luckily we had enough to buy three!  Since I'm there, I got the Voodoo doll donut and she got a regular since she's not really a donut person, but had to try it out!  

Like a few other's said, zero taste + flavor.  I couldn't even finish my little devil voodoo doll, but it's because it's from Voodoo and it's a trend.

Any time of day you go, there will be a line. All the tourists in Portland stop by this place, so yes there will be lines early in the morning too. You'll have to deal with people asking a million questions about what's what, asking for samples, and taking photos with their donuts, especially those brave souls who buy the phallic-shaped ones.

Since I'm an engineer and I fix roads for a living, it seemed fitting to try the pothole donut (chocolate, cream filling, Oreos). I couldn't even get through half of it without running out of coffee to balance out the sweetness overload. I also made the mistake of buying a second donut (Portland creme) which I couldn't finish either. Between the two, I struggled to finish what amounted to one full donut.

You'll see lots of people buy entire boxes. I saw a group of four tourists each walk out with their own individual boxes, and they attempted to eat them in the table area in the alleyway. Those poor souls...

One final HUGE complaint: all their coffee stuff (creamer, sugar, etc.) is on top of the trash can. They can't even spare a little bit of counter space? How does this place not get shut down from this alone? Get your coffee across the alley instead.",2015-10-29 05:37:56

That being said I do think they have a unique marketing strategy all the way down to the pink boxes they give you. We had several people come up to us on the street asking about the donuts and the line because of the pink box.

It was just last September at Universal Studios in California when our party of 10 decided to get a snack. Man, I went down the rabbit hole riding that pink strawberry frosting!  I was hooked!  Had to try the Portland as Bavarian Cream is a lifelong favorite of mine. The doughnuts were light, airy, and at the same time chewy. The BEST doughnuts I have tasted in my Life. 

Fast-forward to a month ago. I live in Southern Oregon, but blessed to have my Son and five grandchildren living in Portland. So, we have gone to their flagship store four times in the last Apx. six months. 

So here comes the three stars (which should maybe be two, but they hooked me, and I'm like a battered wife...I keep going back for more!).  The way we get the doughnuts is to get maybe 8-12 at a time on our way home (a 5-hour trip) and we m-a-y-b-e will eat one in the car. So we did on our first take home. And they were good but not great.  it was such a bummer. They tasted like day-old doughnuts from a grocery store. 

Ugh!!  Sad as we were, we went back a second time with the same result!!  What say you, Voodoo Doughnuts?!? But we called the next day and gently 'complained' the way you might go to a garage sale and 'complain' to the owner that Barbie doesn't have any shoes. 

You know, we were glad handed, and yada yada yada...we went there Again!! (I mean, seriously, could you see my eyes rolling?). So this time, we made sure to ask if the doughnuts were fresh. We were assured they were 'Very Fresh!'  Got down 1-5 past Salem and decided on a doughnut, and they were The Wrong Doughnuts. 

I mean, are they just screwing with us?  Are they doing a weird Candid Camera spin off and we'll get our first residual check any day now!?!  And by the way, we didn't like the ones they gave us. I'm Very persnickety. 

So yes, say it with me... 'We Went There Again'!

So these ones were good. The ones we didn't eat that day were kind of Stale, but you know, we got the doughnuts. So the three stars should be five inasmuch as they have the capacity for greatness.

The Voodoo doughnut contained some type of raspberry filling covered with chocolate frosting. The frosting was good but towards the end, I just felt like the sweetness was too much for my palette. BUT, this was the best donut of the bunch that I ordered. 

Here's my suggestion: Give this place a shot but don't expect some high quality donut. Given that everyone raves about this place, you might as well just make the effort to try it out and then check that off your list that you've been here and tasted it. Then move on...

The shop is kitschy and decorated amusingly, and I was happy that there was a hefty selection of different donuts, even that late at night.  

Once we made it to the counter, the cashier who took our order introduced himself by saying, ""Duuuude, one of my customers tonight tipped me with a joint...""  Clearly.  Here's how the conversation then played out:

Me: ""I'll take the Portland Cream donut and two small coffees, please.""
Stoned cashier: ""Riiiiight.  That'll be (I don't even remember how much because I was stunned he was high!)""

***pay the cashier with cash only - no credit cards***

PROS: 
- very interesting selection of donuts as you probably can see (c*ck and balls? LOL)
- donuts have more goodies to add extra fat to your stomach
- awesome staff
- perfect easily accessible hangover food

CONS: 
- 15 minute wait on a Sunday morning
- line is outside.. Had to wait in the rain
- the menu is not too descriptive of what's in it
- parking here is so weird 


I had the bacon maple donut and the captain crunch berry donut. Both were pretty damn good. The one thing that kind of bugged me was that there wasn't descriptions of the donuts in the menu, or maybe I just didn't see it somewhere. I didn't want to ask our donut guy to tell me every ingredient to every donut.. So I chose the ones which were pretty obvious in what you were going to eat.

Not to take away from their overall creativity, but this place is a little overrated.

Ok, so let me preface this review by saying that I've had couture doughnuts in Chicago; at both Doughnut Vault and the now defunct City Provisions, so my expectations were in line with those when I heard about Voodoo Doughnuts.  I also gave my self a reality check by telling myself that even though they are open all night, this is a Portland institution that Portlanders love, so it couldn't be worse than Dunkin'.

So we went in the morning.  Like 8-9am.  I expected that the doughnuts be at least fresh and warm and delicious.   But I was wrong.  Doughnuts were in a carousal, all cold, and plunked on a napkin.  Luckily, I got a vegan doughnut which used pumpkin and banana instead of eggs but was way too sweet. That was original and deserves a solid 4 if it was only fresh.  

But the sticky point is that my friend got the only doughnut that came ""fresh"" from the oven.  He had eaten only half  before finding the center wasn't cooked.  To his horror, by the end of the day, he started to throw up. 

Yea, this place has the 24 hour thing going for them.  It has the trendy cereal as toppings going for them.  But let's not get overly carried away saying this is any better than the chain donuts shop.  Its a ""fast found donut shop,"" not a true taste pushing doughnut shop.",2013-03-09 17:05:08

Sorry, we're from Chicago, but those were the only two things we even knew about Oregon in general. So when we got to Portland, the number one thing on the list was Voodoo Doughnuts. We knew it was a tourist trap going in, but I didn't expect it to be this bad.

The line was not tremendously long, but we did have to wait in the rain for about five minutes before we were allowed inside. That's understandable- it's hyped up, and there has to be some wait even on an early Sunday morning. When we got in, we saw what we had seen on the shows before: the decor, the atmosphere, and, of course, the doughnuts.

The service was nice, and we got out quickly despite the immense wait we saw. We didn't really know what we wanted, but we picked whatever we saw that looked appealing to some groggy travelers.

Fast forward to the hotel, where we started eating the donuts. The first thing that overcame our senses was staleness and loads of sugar. The shop is open 24/7, so the donuts were clearly about a couple days old. They had the texture of about a day old munchkin from Dunkin Donuts, not so hard as a rock but just hard enough to make anyone be like ""woah, this is stale."" The sugar was another big problem. One donut alone probably had all of the sugar recommended in a daily diet. The recipe must have called for one bag of sugar per donut. To top it off, the donuts gave me E-Coli, not a fun thing to have when you're driving down the 101 South through the redwoods.

So, I guess it boils down to ""Would I come back if I was back in Portland?"" And that answer is a definite no. Maybe I'm being a bit biased because of the fact I got sick from the batch of donuts I ate, but the donuts were NOT worth the hype or money spent on them. Their aesthetic is pleasing, and I can see why it got popular, but something went drastically wrong when we were there. Overall, I give a 1.5/5, but I rounded up to be nice!",2016-03-25 02:24:33

I had to see what all the rage was about.  I went on a Sunday late morning and there was a line snaking along the front.  After standing and waiting in line for about 20 min watching customer after customer come out of the store with a large pink box of doughnuts and smiles on their face I realized the signs that read CASH ONLY.  Seriously?  This was a surprise to many as they came close to entering.  Luckily there is an ATM, so you can eat the bank fees on top of your treats.  

Once inside, the cashier was simply not in the mood to be there. The doughnut options are spinning in displays but nothing to indicate what they are exactly.  Luckily there were a few floating menus out front, none of which made it to me, and an app online to read the selections beforehand.  The list is long, the options are so bizarre they require serious study, and frankly my memory is not THAT good.  I refuse to pay ATM fees and limited my order to whatever cash we had on hand the few doughnut options I was able to remember.  The price tag is appropriate for an over-sized popular novelty at the level of your run of the mill tourist trap.  

The result, good doughnut.  Seemed fresh from that morning, they were nice and doughy inside.  I'm glad I came, but I don't need to return.  I come to Portland often and this will not be a regular stop.  The parts that stuck with me the most: long line; poor customer service; high price tag; and a business more interested in avoiding taxes than offering the convenience of accepting credit cards to their customers.  I know for me, I would've bought way more than necessary and charged it rather than work within the limits of cash in my pocket.",2015-10-16 02:43:39

Food:  The variety of doughnuts is interesting and unique.  I really like how they had a mix of re-invented classics and some unequal ones.  I picked up Voodoo Dolls, Portland Creams, and a few Bacon Maple Bars.  The taste combinations of each were good, but way overly sugary and sweet.  The Voodoo Dolls are your basic bar doughnut with chocolate icing and raspberry filling.  The filling was too sweet and I ended up squeezing out about half of it to make it more palatable.  The Portland Cream had more of a sugary icing filling (I was expecting more of a custard, pastry-cream type of filling) that was also too sweet.  After a few bites of it, I squeezed just about all the cream out of it.  The Bacon Maple Bar has potential with some tweaking.  The doughnut itself was good, the maple icing was too sweet, and the bacon was not ""bacony"" or salty enough.  There just was not that strong sweet and salty contrast I was expecting.  The gimmick of the different types of doughnuts is fun, but the regular donuts you find at Krispy Kream or at any regular coffee shop would probably be more palatable.

Price:  Overpriced considering its doughnuts, but you are paying for the novelty of it.  I bought 9 doughnuts and paid about $20 for them.  The price is reasonable if you are a onetime visitor who is into the gimmick and novelty of the strange and unique doughnut combinations, the definitely too expensive for your daily ""doughnut and coffee"" breakfast.

Atmosphere:  Super touristy, but fun.  I went on a cold, rainy afternoon midweek and the line was out the door.  Once you got inside, the pink walls are covered with voodoo-related posters and other touristy looking things.  There is a huge menu board up front, and two turn table displays that have donuts displayed on them.  The glass turn table units look very dirty and disgusting (I hope they don't actually serve the doughnuts that are in them.)  The glass was covered with all sorts of different substances, as if it has not been cleaned in quick awhile.  Since this is one of the first things you see when you walk it, Voodoo Doughnuts should take more care of keeping it clean.

Staff:  Pretty basic staff with not much personality or friendliness.  Yes, they were covered with tattoos and piercings, but looking physically interesting does not make up for the lack of a simple smile.  The cashier by the door was constantly yelling at people to keep the front door closed.  When it was my turn to order, I was greeted with a ""what do you want?""  Being cheery as I am, I smiled and said hello to the cashier, which normally invokes a smile in return, but that didn't happen this time.  The cashier was accommodating though when I requested to have all my doughnuts placed in a smaller box (I'm traveling and don't have the room to carry the bigger box around.)  She did warn me that the doughnuts will get smashed a bit, but I said that was fine.  She did look like she took some care putting them in the box to minimize smashing.

Over all, it was an experience visiting Voodoo.  As a first timer to Portland, it is definitely a place to visit just to say you have been there.  If the lines were not too long, and the doughnuts where not so sweet I might visit it again (but only if I am really craving a doughnut.)  If I return to Portland I would probably not go out of my way to visit Voodoo again, but definitely a spot to visit as a first timer.",2013-03-07 19:01:41

My wife told her that this was her first time at Voodoo and asked what their most famous donuts were. The server just made a very fed up face as if she would rather be somewhere else before giving a very generic 'depends on what you like' response.

Anyways, after we bought the donuts, we were shocked to find them completely cold. Who goes to a donut shop to eat cold donuts?! Also, both the donuts we tried (Portland Cream and Raspberry Romeo) were absolute rubbish even though we were starving.

So I went, and while the shop itself was very eclectic-looking and had a nice hipster vibe, the donuts were just whatever.  My gf and I got some donut with cereal flakes and stuff on it.  Not good at all.  The cereal part seemed a little stale and the donuts themselves were oversweet.

I don't like doughnuts much as they're usually much too sweet for me. I've tried doughnuts across the country and have never found one I liked except maybe those made at home with very little sugar and no dusting. But I wanted the experience of going Voodoo - if only for my teen who thought it would be 'crazy cool'. 

We drove by at 8 PM on a weekday, there was a CRAZY line outside so we decided to go wait and come back at 11:30. Major oops! The line was even longer! What! Still we parked for $12 for the night and went to Voodoo. There was a 200 person line in front of us with some street performance going on right in the middle. Most people were late teens or twenties and many were drunk. Didn't think I wanted to be in line with my kid, we had even brought our dog, so we sent the poor soul back to the car. My kid got a few cat calls as she was walking back and was upset but still determined to go in and try the doughnuts. 

We then had a few teenagers slam into us as they were being chased by cops for breaking into someone's car or store and then a few cops came running after. It was quite a commotion. A homeless dude then got up on a trash can, he seemed really high and started lecturing the general audience in the line. Another crowd of drunk people showed up and lit cigarettes. Most of the people who had kids or others who did not want to wait left at this point. 

We waited about 1.5 hours to get in. I had typed my order on my phone and handed it to the server who thanked me for that since I was buying a bunch of flavors. A lot of people were just staring at the board inside, lost as they seemed not to have a clue what they wanted, I think they were in the line just for fun. The place is cash only so some were scrambling to get money. The servers were friendly despite all this going on all the time. It's amazing that they sell so many doughnuts, all their racks were full and they were still making more!

So the visit was an experience, that lasted 3 hours to buy a few doughnuts! But I don't think I would have seen more people and more interesting sights in the space of those 3 hours anywhere else!

We got our legendary pink boxes and I tried a bite of each doughnut having got about 15-16 flavors. I wasn't very impressed, the only one I liked was the Buttermilk bar. I had not tasted one like that before and it was not overly sweet. The voodoo dolls were all different and fun to photograph but not to eat. Eventually, I ended up trashing most of the doughnuts. Out of the 24 we purchased we perhaps finished 4-5 over 2 days. And our dog helped too!

Especially since it's not exactly in a great neighborhood (this is coming from someone who lives in Baltimore and has stood in line outside for less.). 

Once inside, the line continues and you are brought into a kitschy but weirdly sexualized lobby area that smells of cloying B.O.

There were a couple of grimy, smelly, drunk bums in front of me  negotiating for stale donuts and coffee.  These guys took forever to conclude their business and then one of the drunk bums spilt his coffee on the counter, thereby wasting more of my time.  Although there were several other employees there, only the one was working at the counter.  Compared to others' waits, however, I guess I was fortunate only having to wait 10 minutes while the transients finished their business.

I noticed that the counter guy didn't even wash his hand after cleaning up the drunk bum's mess before grabbing my donuts, which didn't leave me pleased.

The donuts -- meh.  Yes, they got some weird toppings.  Big whoop.  I got the Memphis Mafia, which wasn't too bad, but it was nothing to write home about and wasn't that particularly fresh.  And they're fairly expensive as far as donuts go.

As others have said, the employees have a too-cool-for-school attitude about them, and take their damn time to wait on paying customers, although they really do go out of their way for penniless, drunk, cackling bums.

The place is painted black -- no doubt to cover stains of one and another sorts from a century or more of prior businesses, as well as the likely cockroaches crawling around.  It's in an old building in an old part of downtown, and I wouldn't be surprised if they have the highest protein content donuts in town, due to the indigenous bugs.

As a bonus, I had to walk past the aforementioned stumbling, cackling, wheezing, coughing bums on my way back to my car and demur on supplication for change on their part.

Not that it was horrible to go to at all. But, in the end, Voodoo Doughnut is still just a doughnut shop. And, honestly, not even that great of one at that.

I convinced Boyfriend that it was worth going to at least EXPERIENCE it -- after all, why go all the way to Portland to only then disappoint people when they ask if we had Voodoo? Luckily, we only waited about 20 minutes in line before we were walking up to the register (surprisingly, the line wasn't too long but it was probably because we went during a time most people are enjoying dinner). A good friend of mine had made a request that, if we went, to please please PLEASE bring her back some Voodoo, so we had a list ready to go to hand over to our cashier. Which he apparently really appreciated. He said it made his job easier!

We got a dozen doughnuts and the total ended up being $24 even (bless the lack of sales tax in Oregon). Still, that's a hefty price to pay for 12 doughnuts. We ordered a voodoo doll, a maple old fashioned, a Captain My Captain, a No Name, a Dirty Snowball, a Memphis Mafia (totally a fritter, not a doughnut and $5!!), a McMinnville, a Mango Tango, two bacon maple bars and two Mexican Hot Chocolate doughnuts.

I personally ate the Captain My Captain, bacon maple and Mexican Hot Chocolate. Not a huge fan of the Captain My Captain -- it was a regular doughnut, liberally covered in icing and cereal. I ended up picking the cereal off to eat and dumping the doughnut. The bacon maple bar was really good though! Savory and sweet, but not overly so in either spectrum. And I should've passed totally on the Mexican Hot Chocolate. It tasted kind of gross to me.

My friend who had requested six of the doughnuts in that list was pretty juiced that we managed to get them to her through security, TSA and flying. Too bad the cabin pressure made them kind of implode on themselves since we individually bagged them into Ziplocs before flying :( But she said they were overall pretty good, but, again, nothing too special.

In the end, they're just doughnuts. I kind of wish I had either a) not gone at all and saved my money, or b) bought a smaller amount. Definitely worth the try, and now I can say I've had Voodoo in Portland, but I don't think I'll be going for return visits.",2014-01-29 19:49:19

Don't get me wrong. I like Voodoo. I just think the hype on the place has exceeded reality. My experience here reminds of the fervor that gripped the area back in the 90's when Krispy Kreme left its southern confines and start popping up in ever city in the US. Lines stretched for hours as devotees and wannabes waited patiently to experience donut nirvana. I joined in the fun and waited with them. And I felt then like I feel now... ""Good donut, why is there a line?""

In all fairness, Voodoo's Chinatown location tends to attract larger crowds than its other two stores, so it is possible to get my favorite maple bacon without standing in a long line.

My boyfriend's take on it -- in his own words: ""For me, the doughnuts were less about the quality and more about experience of eating creative doughnuts.""

Also, they're fairly cheap. Go Oregon with your bad ass no sales tax awesomeness.

We ordered:
-Bacon Maple Doughnut -- I loved it. It is sweet, but it's freaking bacon and bacon is always a win.
-Old Dirty Bastard: Oreos and glaze. My boyfriend ate the entire thing before I got to try a bite but he said he seemed to liked it a lot...hence the eating all of it before I had a chance.
-Voodoo Doll? I think that was the name. I think it's their mascot doughnut. It's got chocolate glaze, frosting face, a pretzel sticking in it's heart and filled with raspberry and I'm a sucker for raspberry and chocolate so I enjoyed it.
-Miami: A freaking explosion of color and frosting. Super sweet. My friend ordered it so I had a bite and that bite was about all I could take.

When I found out I was going to Portland, I reached out to my foodie family and told them I was going to VooDoo Donuts. So we gathered around in the living room and everyone looked at the menu and we compiled a list of what to order. I called that evening and made the order because that way everyone would know I ordered their favorites and it was one less thing to worry about. I called and placed the order and was told it would be waiting for me on Thursday and I said great!

When we arrived the line was less than 10 minutes long...in fact, I was able to walk right into the shop. I gave the lady my name and she went in the back and returned with my huge box. I peeked inside saw that they had multiple levels of donut with waxed paper in between. I didn't doddle because the smell was driving me insane so I went to the airport and flew back to SFO. 

I have to say, I have never been leered at so much in my life. Toward the end, I was feeling I should have an armed guard. But I made it home. When I got home we discovered we had been shorted the VooDoo Doll Donuts! I mean, how do you come back from that? The chocolate I saw through the wax paper was just the Portland Creams.

My usual experience is to coast by, observe the queue strung out down the sidewalk, mutter ""Fuck it"" and ride on.  But today, no line.  It must be some kind of celebration of specialness and therefore I had to stop.

I got the legendary bacon maple bar, the rice krispie peanut butter and just for color, the crunchberries donut.  Took the three to the office to divvy up with my office mates.  I have to say that VDs straight from the kitchen are far better than the bargain bucket o' day-olds that are known to turn up in the breakroom and at bike events.

And still, as fresh as you can get them, underneath the novelty toppings lurks a very average doughnut at a rather high price.

True, the bacon maple is an inspired combo once in a while and I enjoy the peanut butter drizzle on the rice krispies doughnut.  But then the crunchberries are embedded in a hypersweet white glaze that makes the whole thing a little nauseating and silly.  You could go to Safeway, get a fresh doughnut from the bakery, slap a bunch of canned frosting on top and smoosh a bowl of cereal into it and be pretty damned close without venturing past aisle 5.

I am mystified by the aura of awesomeness that surrounds this place when there are plenty of really great doughnuts in this town.

I do give them credit for good basic flavors. And yes, they do have some crazy doughnut concoctions (pun intended) that are interesting to look at, but it was definitely not worth the hour long wait. It was more of an 'experiential' food event. On to the doughnuts: 

The Triple Chocolate Penetration: Chocolate cake doughnut, chocolate frosting, and coco puffs. This was my favorite doughnut of the three. I could do away with the coco puffs though. The chocolate cake doughnut itself was dense yet fluffy and went well with the sweetness of the chocolate frosting. I would have been happy with just the Double Chocolate doughnut.

The Dirt doughnut: Doughnut with vanilla frosting and crumbled Oreos. I appreciated how the frosting tasted like Oreo cream. This doughnut was a bit too sweet for my taste.

The McMinnville Cream: Doughnut with Bavarian cream and maple frosting. The cream was nasty, so I ate around it (the doughnut and frosting made a good pair).",2011-09-10 20:20:59

Personally, I think it's good if you're in the neighborhood and eat one right away.  Give it a few hours and the donut quickly goes stale.  I prefer the Vegan ones, even though that's not how I usually roll.

So if you're reading reviews to decide whether you should give Voodoo a try...I say go for it if you have an extra 2 dollars in your pocket, cause frankly, 2 dollars won't even get you an all zone pass on Tri-met anymore and it'll hardly buy you an hours parking downtown come July 13th.

-PB Oreo: cookies were stale and soft--obviously the doughnut had been sitting for hours. Total let down. I've had better from chain doughnut shots and would not rebuy from Voodoo.

-Mango guava jelly: fun salty tang on top paired with the unique guava jelly. Would rebuy and was a fun twist.

---Maple bacon doughnut: the bacon is not my cup of tea. We ripped off the bacon & were left w/ a maple bar that was good but again just like any other

***BACON MAPLE BAR - Raised yeast doughnut with maple frosting and bacon on top

Stunningly average, just your standard maple bar with a strip of bacon on top. And not that crispy oily ""I could bite the you into a million pieces"" type, but a dull, flat, thick, & chewy variety. As if they gave each other high fives for barely fulfilling the quota to ""Keep Portland Weird"".

***PORTLAND CREAM - Raised yeast doughnut filled with Bavarian cream with chocolate on the top and two eyeballs

Allegedly the official doughnut of Portland, I couldn't have been more bored. This was just about the most nondescript doughnut ever, pedestrian dough, a bit of standard chocolate glaze on top, and filled with an odd, almost clear, water-soluble solution that cried ""Contains no actual milk solids"". 

***MEMPHIS MAFIA - Fried dough with banana chunks and cinnamon sugar covered in a glaze with chocolate frosting, peanut butter, peanuts and chocolate chips on top

This was the closest thing to approachable that we tried--I could taste a bit of banana essence in the dough, and the chocolate and peanut butter combo on top had potential, but in the end the heaviness of this beast became the millstone around its neck. 

***OLD DIRTY BASTARD - Raised yeast doughnut with chocolate frosting, Oreos, and peanut butter

Basically the same as the above, but with no banana flavor, and Oreo chunks on top. 

ALL IN ALL:

The very best experiences I've had with doughnuts have involved eating them fresh out of the oven--this seems to magnify the deliciousness of even the most average doughnut. Unfortunately this isn't the rule of law around Voodoo Doughnuts, where doughnuts are served slightly chilled. And as the prime marker of a doughnut is its unhealthiness, it becomes incumbent upon the chef to disguise her creations with a light fluffiness--this is where Voodoo fails, for the meatiness of half of one of its doughnuts could choke a cow. It's not something where you could gobble three or four down and feel guilty about it--two bites in and you're in the depths of hell, longing for a raw carrot and an enema.",2014-12-29 00:15:29

TEX-ASS CHALLENGE: This is a fun challenge. I came with friends and you know there's always that ONE friend that's willing to go for it haha! You have 80 seconds to finish this huge giant glazed donut. It's huge...pictures don't give it justice. It's equivalent to 6 regular sized donuts. If you eat it all by 80 seconds, it's free. If not, you'll have to pay for it haha. The lady who conducted the challenge didn't the most animated, but other servers did.

VOODOO DOZEN: Since I came with five others, we decided it was worth it to get this. The voodoo dozen is perfect for tourists (like us) that wanted to try 13 of their most popular donuts. I think it was about $24 dollars. Of the ones we bought, I was able to take bites from most of them and these are the ones I tried:

-VOODOO DOLL: I was told that you're supposed to move the pretzel around and the raspberry filling inside the donut is supposed to ooze out. Didn't happen haha. Not a raspberry filling person, so this was a miss for me. 
 
-BACON MAPLE BAR: I love maple bacon bars!! So this one met my standards (: I'd get this again. 

-OLD DIRTY BASTARD: Loved this one! This donut came with chocolate frosting, crushed oreos, and peanut butter. If you love the traditional chocolate and peanut butter combo, this will win you over. I'd get this again, but definitely share because it's on the sweet side. 
 
-PORTLAND CREAM: A donut filled with Bavarian cream. The cream tasted like a light custard. It was whatevers to me. 

-CAPTAIN MY CAPTAIN: Donut with an overly sweet frosting and stale captain crunch. No thanks. 

-TRIPLE CHOCOLATE PENETRATION: Chocolate donut with overly sweet frosting and stale coco puff cereal on top. No thanks again. 

-DIRT: Donut with an overly sweet vanilla and crushed oreos on top. SUPER sweet, but it tasted as I expected it to.

-MARSHALL MATHERS: A very cake-y textured donut with vanilla frosting and covered with mini m&m's. Not my personal taste. 

-NEAPOLITAN: This chocolate cake-y textured donut with vanilla frosting, strawberry dust, and marshmallows.

First off, the appearance of the box seems like a typical pink donut box, but it has a cool inked out design on the top. Simple, but I digged it. We got a wiiide variety of donuts... here's what sticks out in my memory:
- main Voodoo donut (jelly-filled-- my fav actually)
- Blueberry (hybrid of a bagel and donut)
- Cotton candy (awesome but too sweet. shrug, what did i expect)
- Oreo (self explanatory)
- and finally, Bacon-topped donuts.

The bacon-topped donuts remind me of a personal favorite of mine. Has anyone tried the Krispy Kreme donut sandwich w/fried chicken in between, typically sold at local county fairs?? Anyways, i LOVE those, and these bacon topped donuts remind me of them. It leaves this sweet and salty mixture of goodness to your tastebuds, while of course clogging your arteries.

Voodoo doll - only good for looks and photos - thick chocolate glaze, thick jelly inside. What can I say? Sweet. 
Chocolate peanut - the most simple one. It was so recommended I thought I had to try. But SKIP IT. It's the same old sweet chocolate glaze. And there was nothing special about the donut itself. I can't tell what was good about it other than the experience of being in the store.

Imagine just pouring sugar on top of a donut and topping it with some sugary breakfast cereal... that's about the taste we got from most of these. 

The Portland Creme was undercooked toward the center. I could literally taste raw dough. The other donuts were as noted... and the frosting was dry and crackly, as well. Just... unsatisfying.

To sum up my experience at Voodoo: 

Eh.



These donuts are not that great. The infamous bacon maple bar? It tastes like bacon on top of a maple bar. And the maple bar itself? I've had better at QFC. The cock and balls donut was huge (but what else do you expect with that price). That was tasty, but again, nothing special. Tried some of their donuts with cereal on them and a bunch of other ones (which I tried in the Voodoo Dozen). They were all alright, if not a bit stale when I went. But I can definitely live without them. 

And the service is not exactly the friendliest. The person who took my order looked mean and was mean. She copped an attitude and wasn't exactly helpful in helping me decide or pick..nor was she patient. So in the service department? Those people were not particularly charming or ridiculous enough to accept bad behavior from.

HOWEVER, my old buddy just told me about ""Cronuts"" (half Croisant, half Donut) out of New York City.  Google it Gentle Ben, I am NOT kidding!!  All this on ""National Doughnut Day""???  Can't we make it ""National First Responders Day"" and give every Cop, Fireman, EMT, et al a free doughnut and let the Doughnut makers get their publicity THAT way??  Oh, by the way, ALSO today, Dominoes Pizza announced they are in ""Research and Development"" of a ""Drone"" that will deliver fresh, HOT Pizza to your door via a little mini helicopter!!  They are calling it the ""Domicopter""...  You can't make this S*** UP FOLKS!!!  What next???  The ""Crone"" will deliver Cronutz and Coffee???  Call your Lawyer and get in line NOW!!!  People will be shooting them out of the skies!!  Especially if they're delivering Medical Marijuana!!  'Scuse me, I'm gunna go hide under my bed......

Oh YEAH...  VooDoo DOES make a Damn good Doughnut, but you'd have to wait in line everyday for a MONTH to try all the different offerings..  And they don't even HAVE a ""Cronut"" yet...

It's a very attractive ""counter-culture"" hangout that's safe enough for mom and dad to not freak out over if they find out that you went there with Amy and Steve (or whoever your high school friends are).  Furthermore, the doughnuts are creative and very fun looking.  Looking at them rotating in the display case is like being in a confectionery jewelry store where the gems will rot your teeth.  Fun, yes?

Still, as fun and cool and yet still safe as Voodoo is, the doughnuts aren't superior.  They are good, but not fantastic.  Interesting, but not delicious.

The donuts were interesting and cute... and some were original and so-so tasty.  However the ones topped with cereral were STALE!!!! shame! 

They were also much too pricey for what they actually were.  
I thought:  Am I paying for just the gimmick of having ""CRAZY"" donuts, just to say that I've been here?!?!?  Yes, yes I was.

And while the maple bacon bar is wonderful, I can achieve the same type of donut by buying a plain ol maple bar from my local supermarket and plopping one piece of bacon on top.  Wait, if I make it at home I could add 2 slices!!  Double your pleasure~

Key Points:
Staff: rude, slow, couldn't handle the long line.
Food:  overpriced, average tasting donuts, toppings were unique but not worth it.

Voo doo doughnuts is a donut spot tourists usually hit during their trip into Portland, OR. I heard that the doughnuts tasted good, but were not anything special, and my expectations were met. The doughnuts here are better than your usual donut place, but not good enough to be waiting in a line longer than 15 minutes. The only reason why I see Voo Doo doughnuts being so popular is because of their odd and tacky doughnut shapes and names.
 
The most popular doughnut here is the Voo Doo doll. It is a basically a chocolate donut with raspberry filling. I was sad that the raspberry filling was only located in the bottom half of the doll. I wish the donut was filled more with the filling. I also had the vicious hibiscus doughnut. This donut was again, decent, but didn't blow me away.
 
We had to wait around 20 minutes until we were ordering. Once you're inside, you notice that the donuts you are selecting from are located behind glass, in a carousel type machine.  They have at least two in there, so guests can look at the doughnuts they'd like to order while waiting in line.
 
So yes, there is nothing special about voo doo doughnuts if you're a donut fanatic looking for the best donut in Portland. The names of the doughnuts are funny and creative, but that's about it. The only time I'd come back is if my friends have never been.",2018-03-31 05:38:19

I am a true lover of donuts but I really think Voodoo Doughnuts is just okay. Outrageously decorated, overly sweet and interesting combos is probably what makes people so excited about Voodoo Doughnuts. We have something comparable to it back at home so I wasn't as excited. We came on a weekend night and the line wasnt as packed as we expected.

We had the bacon donut, voodoo doll, grape and cinnamon sugar donut. Nothing really stood out or felt life changing. It was actually too sweet and slathered with way to much frosting. Their menu is overwhelming and the rotating donut shelves don't help. It's hard to know whats in the case so you kind of just have to point and hope that it'll taste good. I thought that they'd have amazing donuts and when trying the plain Cinnamon Sugar donut, it was actually dry and hard to eat.

I'd likely pass on coming back next time if I ever come back to visiting Oregon again. (Bay Area folks, it's similar to Psycho Donuts so if you've already had that, Voodoo donuts is nothing special)",2014-11-06 06:39:16

Voodoo seems to be novelty over substance. Sure, there are wild toppings and flavors. However, underneath it all, you should have a superb cakey or fluffy donut. My hibiscus frosting tasted badly artificial, and the donut itself was on par with something you would buy at Safeway.

Also, I disliked that you don't see the donuts until you get to the register.

On a Monday night at 9:30, there was about a fifteen minute wait to get in the door and order. This 15 minute was made all the more excruciating by the group of panhandling dirty street kids huddling a mere foot from the line of people at Voodoo. Add in the two or three homeless men standing under the sign, closer to the door, and you have an immediate bad impression on this place.

But, I'm from LA and have seen way worse, so it's not a huge personal sticking point, but a definite point to bring up for the few living under rocks that haven't heard of Voodoo Doughnut. The maple bacon bar was overpriced and way too sweet. Like... twice as sweet as your average doughnut frosting. The combo of maple and bacon is tried and true, but I could pass it up in doughnut form.  

Believe it or not, the other donuts from Voodoo are legitimately good. Namely the classic blueberry, which was perfectly crispy on the outside, and fluffy and flavorful on the inside. The Mexican hot chocolate doughnut isn't just cocoa and cinnamon - it gets an extra kick of cayenne pepper that really sets it apart. Luckily for all of us, the non-touristy varieties are considerably cheaper. 

Like a lot of these overhyped places, you can enjoy them if you do your research. In the case of Voodoo Doughnut, that research comes in the form of skipping this location in lieu of the other location in Portland. Or, for those like myself who were heading back south down Interstate 5, just hit up the quiet location in Eugene. If you must, snap a photo of yourself at night in front of the awesome neon sign at this location and then get out of dodge before you're guilted into sparing some change.",2013-07-23 17:38:14

Bacon may be the sole reason I haven't been able to go back to being a pescetarian (which I was for 5+ years until 2011) so I was pretty set on getting the maple bacon which ended up being the only one I ate as the rest were presents for my mom's lucky coworkers. I'm all about the savory/sweet balancing act so I really enjoyed the maple bacon combo. And because the maple glaze was so sweet the salty bacon matched it perfectly and the crunchy aspect of the bacon really enhanced it as well.

Their doughnuts are unique and slightly provocative (Cock-N-Balls doughnut anyone?) Although they now have 6 locations I knew I had to visit their flagship doughnut shop. Sometimes you have to give in to the inner tourist and visit a place like Voodoo Doughnut. It's true that if you've never been then it is worth a stop. Be prepared to wait anywhere from 15 minutes to an hour for the doughnuts of your craving. They have a roped area outside where the hoards of people wait. We waited for probably about 40 minutes to order. 

My friend and I got a box of 4 donuts: 
-The pothole: a Bavarian creme chocolate bar topped with Oreos
-The Voodoo doll: A raised yeast doughnut filled with raspberry jelly
-The dirty snowball: A chocolate cake doughnut with a pink marshmallow topping, coconut shavings and peanut butter in the middle
-Double chocolate: A chocolate cake doughnut with chocolate frosting decorated with the anarchy symbol

Although we got some donuts just because they looked fun and cool my favorite taste-wise was just the double chocolate (boring I know). I guess it just goes to show that something can be beautiful or decorated nice but it all comes down to the taste. My favorite doughnut in Portland was actually a blueberry doughnut from Blue Star paired with Stumptown coffee...it doesn't get better than that!

But then they were featured on the Travel Channel last year, and maybe somebody started believing they had something big on their hands and needed to go corporate and maybe eventually do franchises!  Pure speculation here, but more on that later.

Important note: they only take cash !!!!!!!


So the service is spotty, and often rude, or  sometimes nice.  Just ask for a Voodoo Dozen and save both of you some awkward moments of eye rolling.  They have a strict policy that they pick what goes in the voodoo dozen so just let them fill the pink box in peace.  If you have a group, order the Big As Texas donut and a bear claw/apple fritter (they will fit in the pink box on top of your dozen).  If you have kids, order the bubble gum donut and a blue berry donut (so sweet only a kid can eat it anyway), the tang is excellent for the kid inside all of us.  The peanut butter and chocolate covered oreo donut will keep a teenager quiet for a good ten minutes.  The jelly filled maple bar with a pretzel stake is a favorite.  The old fashion cake donuts make up half your voodoo dozen and you will appreciate having them after you discover how overly sweet the weird ones are.  The weird half of the dozen we slice up to about bite size and let everyone in the group sample them all.

 They have about twenty picnic tables in the narrow street next to them so this is perfect for a larger group on a fair weather day.  Otherwise, smell your pink box all the way home and slice it up there.  Put the donuts inside a zip loc bag to keep them soft over night.  Walk two blocks south on 3rd to Stump Town cafe on the left and get some awesome espresso to go with your donuts.

Okay, back to my speculation.  I first started going to Voodoo about five years ago (I was heading to work after at o' dark thirty and it was too early for my bagel shop (yes, THAT early) and so I remembered the suggestion of Voodoo. I was definitely the office hero that morning with my Voodoo dozen.then last fall they closed their old tiny location on 3rd for remodeling (i.e.after the travel channel debut) but we found our way across the Burnside bridge to their new second  bigger location off Sandy boulevard.  There was a huge line, but it went fast, about twenty minutes.  The donuts were okay, but not as good as I remembered.

Then they opened up the original spot here on 3rd & Burnside, they moved in to the corner nook of the building and so now half the line can at least stand in queue inside where it's warm rather than freeze outside the whole time.  Half the time the staff are yelling""close the door""to the customers who want to let the cold air in the store while they are waiting in line. And then the taste and quality of the donuts/ingredients really hit below average. I'm disappointed and have been trying different places for my monthly donut fix now.

From here, if you are going up Burnside to visit Powells(largest book store in the world) I highly recommend Cacao Cafe on 13th avenue across Burnside from Powells.  They have drinking chocolate that is very rich but surprisingly not very sweet and makes an excellent compliment to your pink box of donuts!

Honestly, it doesn't matter what people say of the place. It's a Portland hot spot/brand because it embodies everything the ~30 crowd tries so desperately to pride itself on; originality. It's been featured in papers, on radio, in all other forms of advertising, highlights on Food Network...

Portland loves weird, and it doesn't get any odder than Voodoo Doughnut, which is basically just a small kitchen below a drug den. At the end of the day, no amount of low ratings are going to turn people away because it's become so ingrained into the local culture. The amusing part, though? Voodoo Doughnuts is the epitome of a Carefully Curated Corporate Culture. They are the very thing they appear to be against, what with the insane amount of graffiti, tatted-up staff, ""cash only"" transactions, and ""cah-razy"" looking storefront/interiors.

And I applaud them for that. They have the best marketing money can/can't buy.

If you walk-in expecting good customer service, high-quality pastries, or quality ambiance, you're not in the right place. And complaining about not getting any of the previous isn't going to force them to change things as, trust me, they don't need you. You're not at Voodoo for the food, you're there for the ""experience"" of saying you've been there.

Well, it's kind of like two words put together. You take 'over' and you take 'rated' and mush them up. Oh what, talk about donuts?

Everyone hypes this place up like these donuts will knock your socks off. And it tears me up to have to inform you that they are lying. Probably not intentionally, but still a lie. 

I waited in a 20 minute lineup on a Saturday night(mistake, never go then) for vegan donuts that were comparable to Tim Horton's(Canadian thing, like Dunkin Donuts. Not good, not vegan.) while some dickbags behind us gassed on at the top of their lungs about how they didn't have any cash, and wouldn't be able to buy any donuts. Oh! Misery!

I expected Voodoo to be a minimum 3 star experience, riding off the novelty of being able to purchase a box of 'fresh' vegan donuts after midnight but listen, this is Portland and vegan EVERYTHING is everywhere! Vegan tattoo parlours, vegan strip clubs, bars, and yes, vegan donuts! You can do so much better at any of the vegan bakeries in the NE. Sweetpeas, Dovetail, Back to Eden... or even non-veg bakeries that just make better vegan donuts.

I theorize that Voodoo, once upon a time, was a smaller operation that used better quality ingredients to craft some nifty donuts and that lead to their current reputation, which transformed them into the 24 hour tourist trap sloppy donut factory shitshow it is today. Success is a curse sometimes.

I bought a selection of 9 vegan donuts, gave 2 away(including the one with preztel cock) and ended up throwing 4 in the trash. 

Tourists: Should you go? Maybe. It is the quintessential Portland experience, but just don't expect the donuts to be legendary or even great. They are just okay. In fact some were down-right gross, like the lemon jelly powdered donut. And I LOVE powdered donuts.

Oreo/Peanut Butter Donut - this was my favorite! 

Old Fashion Blueberry Donut - very simple but good! You can taste the blueberry and the donut itself was pretty light.

However, (un)fortunately I didn't feel like waiting in line for ~1 hr the previous day and decided to give Blue Star a try (no wait!). 

Here are the pros of Voodoo: 
1. Creative concoctions with fun medleys of different flavors. Great variety of donuts as well
2. Fun names! And I'm quite a sucker for fun names
3. Overall quality of the donuts are better than the average donut shop with strong and delicious flavors (we ordered a dozen donuts so we can safely judge away!)

Here are the cons of Voodoo: 
1. Although the overall quality of donuts is great, no particular donut had a wowza factor. The texture was meh and not the kind of melt-in-your-mouth-ness that one would anticipate after an hour long wait. I literally cannot remember one particular donut that I loved out of the 12 different donuts that we ordered
2. I had tried the Bacon Maple donut at Blue Star the previous day and was left SO disappointed after trying Voodoo's version of that. Voodoo's version was soggier, overly-sweetened and literally had an entire piece of overly salty bacon in the donut. I'm not talking about little chunks of bacon - I'm talking about a massive slab of breakfast-style bacon. It was a bit much and the flavor was completely lacking 
3. The line. Thankfully, we didn't have to endure the notorious wait because we went at 7pm on Christmas Eve. However, I've heard that the wait can be quite arduous

Thus, if you're craving some delicious gourmet donuts and are trying to decide between Blue Star and Voodoo, I would highly recommend the former over the latter. Blue Star has less variety and less fun names but significantly better quality and more meticulously made donuts.",2014-12-29 22:21:58

Does talking to the friendly homeless guy selling newspapers to the people in line add to said excitement? Definitely.

A little, especially since there was a long line behind us staring at me with vulture eyes hungry for doughnuts.

THE GOOD:
Tons of variety. Really unique donuts. You're bound to find something you like.
My favorites: Portland Cream, The Voodoo Doll, Diablos Rex, and Old Dirty Bastard.

THE BAD:
The wait - on a Sunday morning around 10:30a, we waited an hour in line. There's really no donut in the world that's worth this kind of wait - but when in Portland, I had to try it.
Cash only - I get it, I just really like to use my credit card.

A previous reviewer mentioned that he/she didn't know what kind of toppings were on each uniquely named flavor of donut so I will describe what we ordered the best we can.  

OLD DIRTY BASTARD: This was probably my favorite one...it had chocolate frosting, oreo cookies, and peanut butter on top of a ring donut

NO NAME: Chocolate frosting, rice crispies, and peanut butter...2nd fave

MANGO TANGO: Some sort of fruit frosting on top stuffed with mango preserve (I think)

MAPLE BACON BAR:  Self-explanatory.  The bacon was very crisp though so that was nice

VOODOO DOLL:  Jelly doughnut shaped like a voodoo doll complete with pretzel stuck in heart.

These donuts aren't bad but for the wait time and how much you hear about these donuts these were somewhat of a letdown.  The dough wasn't as light or fresh tasting as other places.  They had some very interesting and delicious combinations though although the frosting and toppings made the doughnuts super duper sweet.

Problem solved!  I can get the ""cock-n-ballz"" doughnut while their large sign reminds me that ""good things come in pink boxes.""  I can even enjoy a large chocolate doughnut with raspberry filling that features a centrally placed ""voodoo pin"" near crotch height.  Yes!

- old dirty bastard: covered in a variety of tasty chunky stuff including chocolate
- the chocolate frosted raspberry filled one with a ""voodoo pin"" in it (but skip the filling part - it's the chocolate that wins it)

Voodoo is a novelty and is a must-go if you're visiting Portland. We came on a weekday and it was about a 30 minute wait. Right around the corner is Ristretto, so I recommend picking up some coffee and waiting in line with a cup of joy. Don't forget to save about half the cup to go along with your donuts ;)

There are a ton of different flavors so after some Yelp research while waiting in line, here's the cliffnotes:
- Voodoo donut: their signature. Personally, I do not like jelly donuts, but it's the traditional voodoo shaped donut and it's fun to see its jelly blood ooze out when you take a malicious bite.
- Portland Cream Donut: A must get if you like cream filled donuts. I really liked this one. It reminds me of Krispy Kreme donuts cream filled donuts, but better consistency and fluffier!
- Bacon Maple donut: My favorite!! I usually don't eat bacon but ate it especially for this donut. A must have. I would say this is their famous donut.
- Arnold Palmer: I like simple, lemon-y donuts. I highly recommend this if you like something on the tamer side.

I am not a huge fan of overwhelming flavors so I didn't try the ones topped with a ton of cereal or chocolate... so those four above are the ones I recommend you to get. 

Upon paying, the cashier gave me two free maple donuts on top of the four that I ordered.. d'oh. I felt sluggish the rest of the day. haha. that was oddly nice of him. I was also surprised to see the donuts are reasonably priced!

Then we get there and watch the line spiral all up and down the streets, across the streets.. it would take a few hours to get in. Seriously. And, it has nothing to do with the day of the week or time. I've been there at night time, morning time, evening, on week days and weekends. That's why it was good that they put one down here in the Eugene/Springfield area. I got to try their food. It's good, but definitely overpriced and not worth too much hype. They're creative, but half the time, the donuts are stale, and the other half they're okay. The donuts are super sweet, I like the oreo cookie one and my husband likes the maple-bacon one.

Apparently it's been featured on channels like the food network and the travel channel and it's off beat decor / attitude is amusing to those from out of town e.g. their sign slogan of ""the magic is in the hole"" sets the tone for what you'll find inside.  In addition, the variety of donuts is amazing - vegan donuts and normal donuts side by side on the menu with some of their items being just as kooky as the decor.  Donuts topped cereal and the voodoo donut, a man shaped donut with raspberry filling and a pretzel stabbed through the chest, comes to mind.

Still, I don't really see what the fuss is about personally.  Their doughnuts are decent in flavor, but it's not 5 (or even 4 star for me) quality.  On top of that, 9 times out of 10 you're looking at a line that goes around the corner of the block - about a 20 to 30 minute wait sometimes.  Finally, the interior shop area is tiny so unless you've been there multiple times, you'll probably be a little flustered / bewildered about what to order especially with a line of people behind you.  

Tips - if it's your first time there and you're willing to be adventurous, try the ""voodoo dozen"" - a dozen donuts that are randomly chosen by the person tending the cash register.  That should give you a fair random sampling without having to figure out on the spot what to order.

I really expected to be back in line for a dozen more, fidgeting in a sugar induced craze, but instead I sat outside at those intensely purple picnic tables sad and well, disappointed.  Overall, the doughnuts alone would be 3 stars. The texture wasn't soft and fresh, but borderline stale and it was only about 3pm.  Poor customer service really underscored my dislike for this location and disappointment in Voodoo. Sad to see that other Yelpers have had the pleasure of experiencing this kind of treatment too.

Voodoo Doughnuts is known for its offering of fun flavors and combos. I really enjoyed watching the colorful selection spin in the display case as we waited in line to order. But le huz, baby girl and I ultimately decided upon some ""tamer"" options. A Classic Portland Cream (chocolate covered donut with custard filling), a Bacon Maple bar (exactly like it sounds, only rather than covering the bar with bacon bits, you actually get two short strips of bacon on top), and ooh, Cock n Balls. That's right. Cock n Balls. Think two Portland Creams (as the balls) connected to a twist version of the Portland Cream as the wiener - which is then decorated with a rainbow and the text, ""TASTE THE RAINBOW""... wahaha.

When we rolled in to town, three places were recommended to us, Voodoo being the most consistently recommended. Blue Star being the second recommended and Annie's Donuts being the lesser known. 
The first thing to know about Voodoo is that you will wait. This appears to be a tourist trap that is fun, quirky, and in a convenient location. The homeless appear to know this and were practically camped outside of the place, bluntly asking for a donut or a $5. 
We waited about 30-45 minutes to get inside the place. 
The interior is equally fun, making the wait worth it as you have to read all the interesting descriptions for their donuts. If you like the famous: maple bacon or The Homer Simpson. The stranger ones that looked like they had fruit loops attached to the top of them. I'm a fan of classic chocolate glazed and really did enjoy it. Our overall impression of the actual taste of the donuts was mediocre/good. I don't even remember how they tasted, but this place was memorable because of the niche they built in Chinatown, Portland. 
My advice: if you're up for touristy, go for it. The donuts are all right and its a fun location. Skip Blue Star. If you're a serious fan of donuts go to Annie's Donuts. It's a bit further away and less explosive in creative flavors, but their recipe is AMAZING and were the best donuts we had on this trip.",2016-06-20 23:50:54

The inside was TINY. I would think they could dish out a little cash to expand the storefront a bit or at least reorganize to make it less of a hassle for customers.

Aren't they more like sugar-laden and diabetes-inducing fried calories, ready to prompt a massive heart attack after ingestion? Perhaps I'm being over-dramatic. I mean, Voodoo's toppings only consist of bacon, various cereals from my childhood, bubble gum, candy bars, and good ol' chocolate frosting. What is SO bad about that? 

Any tourist visiting Portland will have to make a trip to Voodoo Doughnut. It's almost sacrilegious if you don't. Like people will stare and judge you. Are Voodoo's doughnuts really that remarkable? Considering the ridiculous lines, you'd think so. I waited roughly 30 minutes and it was late afternoon...not really prime doughnut consumption time. 

My boyfriend and I decided to try three of their sugary creations. None of them were memorable-- in a positive way. They were all extremely sweet. I was disappointed that the doughnuts were not warm. I'm assuming with the millions of people who visit daily, their stuff is all fresh. 

Maple Blazer Blunt Doughnut - raised yeast doughnut dusted with cinnamon sugar. The tip is dipped in maple frosting and red sprinkles. This doughnut is supposed to resemble a blunt (how Portland), and is a nod to their basketball team, the Trailblazers. I love maple frosting and cinnamon so I thought this doughnut would be perfect for me. Yet, the sugar + cinnamon + sprinkles + maple frosting were too sweet for me. 

McMinnville Cream Doughnut - raised yeast doughnut filled with Bavarian cream with maple frosting. Two eyeballs and a swirly mustache are drawn on the top. The Bavarian cream was thick and rich. I would have liked this without the cream so I should have gone with the plain maple bar doughnut.

Old Dirty Bastard Doughnut - raised yeast doughnut with chocolate frosting, Oreos, and peanut butter. Sweet Jesus. This was TOO much. My boyfriend and I ended up throwing it away, half-eaten. I can appreciate Voodoo's creative and wacky flair but dang. I might as well have been shoving sugar straight into my mouth. The first bite was fine; however, every bite after that was arduous and the flavors just started meshing into one chocolaty mess. 

The doughnuts here aren't that decadent or to-die-for. I understand the concept of hipster doughnuts with crazy flavors, but they're average doughnuts that are just sugar bombs. Voodoo's infamous pink boxes are emblems of this sweet shop's prominent rise. However, you're not missing out on too much if you skip this ""top"" culinary destination.

It's worth mentioning that Voodoo Doughnut's neighbor is Paris Theatre, an adult movie theater. So as you stand in line waiting for your fried carbs, you have this classy establishment to keep you company.",2014-08-22 05:04:18

After waiting in line for an hour in a cashless society and being told that they only accept cash, the glazed over staff pointed me to an atm behind me that had an 8$ service charge to buy an equally expensive doughnut that tasted like it came from last weeks second quality bin.

The doughnuts I had been reading about in various foodie magazines for so long had been discontinued. I was a little bummed that the NyQuil Glazed doughnut and the Vanilla Pepto Crushed Tums doughnut were no longer sold. 

The disappointment I felt when trying this place for the first time was far from epic as many other reviewers have described.
I was disappointed, such as driving an hour out of the way to see the worlds largest peanut, knowing its a tourist trap only to get to it and see a statue and a plack.  

What a bummer!

Nice pink box and graphic artwork !

For all my family and friends that come to visit and just like reading VooDoo doughnut's vulgar and crass menu and seeing their faces for the first time that is worth three stars.

Voodoo Doughnut was one of the repeated suggestions from friends back home in San Francisco, so we had to try it out.  We drove up on Sunday night, around 11pm, hoping to get a crack at some of these so called delicious donuts.  This was a complete no go.   After finding a parking spot a block and a half away, we arrived to a lineup of ~50 or so people waiting for donuts, plus maybe another 10-15 vagrants who smelled really bad haggling folks for cash.  With no washroom, and no hope of getting out of there any time soon, we bailed and came back Monday evening.

Turns out that Monday evenings have a much shorter lineup, but the 10-15 bums were still hanging around.   Parking was a lot easier, so at least two aspects got better overnight.  We got inside and I was a bit shocked to see that these donuts were mostly just regular donuts with cheap crap thrown on them.  Really?  Captain Crunch on a donut?  Fruit Loops?  Rice Crispies?  How old is the target audience for these donuts?

I was happy to see that they had a bunch of vegan options, so I kindly asked for a dozen donuts, half regular, half vegan, letting them choose.  I was surprised to see their prices:  $7 for a dozen 'regular', $10.75 for a voodoo dozen (wtf does that mean?)  They also listed another *something* dozen, but that part of their menu was covered up by storage crap.

The guy at the counter, a douchebag hipster that looked like he *loved* his job, agreed and boxed us up the dozen.  ""$15"".   WTH?   I don't think I've ever paid this much for donuts.  Way to make me feel ripped off.

Fast forward to a couple hours later.  We're sitting in our hotel room with 10 donuts left, each with a single bite taken out of them.  I would have been better off going to Safeway and sprinkling cereal on them myself.

Maybe Top Pot Hand-Forged Doughnuts in Seattle will satisfy my cravings...",2010-07-27 04:52:33

But what Voodoo provides is an interesting take on your average doughnut. With several different varieties from your classic filled doughnut (mango tango please) to the fritters (apple or banana), they try to please everyone. Their options are endless. I wouldn't say it's the best doughnut Portland but it's close to the top of a very short list.

If you're looking to add at least one doughnut shop to your list, I'd recommend a few others. But if you're looking for a place to say ""Hey, I went there"" then you might as well try Voodoo.

I ordered a voodoo doll and an old dirty bastard with chocolate icing, peanut butter, and oreos. They were pretty good, nothing to rave about. This probably happens a lot on Yelp, but I would choose Blue Star over Voodoo, any day. A lot of Voodoo's flavors were for the most part, flavor profiles I've already seen done before. The voodoo doll's raspberry jelly was pretty damn good, though. The old dirty bastard was kind of dry (lol) but I'm assuming it's because of the peanut butter. Make sure you have a drink at hand!

Location is prime. It's right across from the Keep Portland Weird Sign, and a short walk to Stumptown, the waterfront park, and Powell's. 

I'm kind of stuck between wanting to give them a 3 and a 4, so I'll give them a 3.5 because of the overall experience. It's a cool place to visit at least once to get the whole Portland experience if you're not local. It's one of those kind of things where you go just to say you did. Their donuts are kind of a novelty item. The voodoo doll was creepily cute and the atmosphere was edgy.

The revolving display cases were fun to see. The menu above was kind of hard to read, and it was a little difficult to read signs in the display as it was revolving, so it was kind of overwhelming trying to pick a donut. As we walked out we realized that there was a menu outside on the wall that we totally missed, so that was the only con of walking right through the door because there's not a long line.

The donuts: they're ok. Mostly too sugary though. I enjoyed the Ole Dirty Bastard with oreos and peanut butter glaze. The Mexican Hot Chocolate was a standout buttermilk traditional donut. As far as the highly-touted maple bar with bacon... I could pretty much go to my local grocery store and buy a maple bar and fry up some bacon, slap it on the donut and have it all done in less time than it takes waiting in line at Voodoo.

Second time took a friend both of us felt this is overrated.

(She felt after the long wait in line and considering the price and the great reputation the ""wanting donut"" needed to be mentioned. She only showed the scant filling and said nothing else.)  The young man behind the counter acted extremely ""put out"" and worked to make the guest awkward. He dramatically tossed the donut away and reluctantly replaced with the same (skimpy filled lemon).

Everyone in the third party agreed that there was nothing worth the rave here.

Won't be a fourth visit. Not when Every Day Is A Donut Day, in Hillsboro generously fills their donuts, has a variety of flavors, goes out of the way to make an experience positive, is priced so the experience is worth talking about.

What I didn't like, however, is that A: it's cash only.

It's a Portland staple and one of the tourist traps I felt like checking out for the hell of it even if a great majority of these reviews says it's A-OK.

Brian and I wanted to check out this location the very first day we arrived in Portland, but before we even decided to check it out a bazillion of cops fled to the area to see whatever kind of illegal activity is going on. We waited until the next day, and we got pretty lucky with not running to a long line extending to the corner of the street. While we were chatting it up with some other tourists visiting this shop, we didn't realize that it was one of ""cash only"" places, but luckily, there were was an ATM inside and outside of the donut shop.

As far as the variety of donuts, it's just basically your standard donuts with some extra weird garnishes with pretty creative names. I tried one of the employee's favorite donuts and the maple bacon bar. For the maple bacon bar, I wished they would've garnish the bacons on top of the maple bar in to bits instead of strips. Even though the combination was satisfying, I thought it would be better if it were bits. On the other hand, the employee's favorite which was the Oregon Cream was real tasty. I liked the chocolate glaze on the outside with the light cream on the inside. However, the two random dots toward the edge of that donut was a bit odd for me and would be better if it was decorated more.

Overall, be aware that the donut shop you're about to enter is deep in the hood... Bring pepper spray or someone who has kick ass self-defense skills with you to wait line.

Alas, crashing down to reality... We were fortunate to enough to come at a time where there was no line to speak of. We bought a dozen different doughnuts to share and try.

There were some stars that stood out - the classic Voodoo Doll and the Maple Bacon Bar. The Voodoo Doll was playfully delightful with it's raspberry filling combined well with the chocolate topping. The Maple Bacon Bar was a good play with the salt and sweet contrasting flavors. It wasn't overwhelming sweet either, which was nice.

I can agree with the hype but there's other things that makes this joint standout from the rest. The location, the ambience, the community and its personality. 

The location is ideally located in a cultural melting pot of both savory and sweet. Walking around the 5 mile radius of the shop, its clear that there's a cultural transition and its not really a border per se but rather an ensemble of mixed theme shops and restaurants that is as diverse as its tourists. In return, it offers an ambience that caters to all walks of life. Its not mainly focused on the tourist trade but also offers a bit of Portland's weird personality in their dough. 

The shop offers a lot of appeal with its alternative and unique personality. Its a first and how else can you successfully introduce a sub rosa lifestyle through the public rather than through a sweet piece of cooked dough. Brilliant really, but not unique. 

To critique their donuts, its unique and has good ensemble. The idea is to buy a piece, enjoy it with your favorite warm drink and you carry on. Most of the negative reviews I read about it are from people who sugar-binge with a dozen and devour it all. Ever heard of Diabetes and Obesity? Yeah, America. 

Besides the hype, they deliver some of the unique combinations of Donuts that I haven't seen elsewhere. I may have heard it through the Food Network but their application is very spot on (Shout out to the Guava Donut). I just hope that they stay grounded with their ever expanding brand and possible franchise. Some joints lose their essence and gives in into corporate greed.

I didn't expect there to be a line, take this into account when you pay for parking. Luckily the line moved quickly because I didn't put that long on my meter. 

I'm also glad I'd checked out their menu online and already knew what I wanted, but they all have funky names, but most of them don't actually tell you what the donut combinations are and if there's a line up behind you it's hard to ask what everything is, etc. 

They were out of crullers which was a disappointment, but the ones I did buy were fresh and huge and very tasty!  

Also this place is CASH ONLY! There's an ATM inside though. 

So final decision: The line, cash only and ordering being complicated if you don't already know what you want knock it down a star.

I waited about 1 hour 45 minutes for the donuts on a hot summer's day. The way wasn't that bad throughout because there were lots of things around me to look at. The shop is located in this awesome alleyway with restaurants and many people are there.

But let's get on to the donuts. I had bought a dozen of assorted VooDoo where you get to choose whatever donuts you want. I didn't really do comprehensive research before coming, but I knew the couple of donuts that I HAD to get that VooDoo was staple for. The cost at the end surprised me because it was about $28 for a dozen.. and i was dying. I didn't know how expensive it would be.

The taste: all these donuts to me weren't so special because you can find about 90% of the donuts at your typical hole-in-the wall donut shops down here in Southern California. I had a bite of all the 12 and I was not impressed by any of them.

VooDoo is good because there aren't a lot of donut shops up there in comparison to SoCal, but it's a totally fine donut shop to eat at. It just wasn't anything special to me.

Not worth the wait because I wouldn't have to wait down in socal for anything. BUT it's a fine donut shop :)",2013-11-13 03:04:14

The doughnuts themselves are good if they are the more ""basic"" varieties, the wild ones seemed to be more for children or hype rather than anything else.  Definitely a must eat day of otherwise half the toppings are all soggy and sad (they use a lot of cereal).

The Doughnuts were good. Not the best I've ever eaten, but they looked cool and my 3 year old inhaled hers!! So, I'm not sure if it was the taste or the visual aspect that did that. Haha 

There's an abundance of seating next to the building in a well lit, clean alley. The alley also serves as entrances to other shops and bars. Beware: atleast one bar there is a strip club and another one is a demonic night club with loud rock/scream music. 

The doughnut Prices were reasonable, nothing too ridiculous. The most popular doughnut they sell, which looks like a voodoo doll is only $2.75 - which I was convinced was going to be closer to $7, but like I said it's only $2.75 

There's no free public parking. Only street pay to park parking & pay to park parking lots. Normal for any city.

I was disappointed after bringing out our pink box and taking a bite out of each of the doughnuts, hoping at least one would make me squeal in delight. Fortunately the wait was not long at all during a late Wednesday afternoon. Doughnuts selected were:

Maple Bacon: just like any maple doughnut you'd find elsewhere with 2 strips of bacon on top. Less bacon-y than I thought it would be

Dirty Old Bastard: my favorite out of the bunch. Decadent, chocolate and peanut butter all up in my mouth

Portland Creme: custard doughnut. A little too much filling that quickly became overwhelming

Voodoo doughnut (Christmas edition): cute little voodoo doll shaped doughnut with red and green icing plus a mint on the forehead for Christmas. I liked it better than I thought I would have, considering I'm not usually a jelly doughnut fan. Jelly tasted a more fresh than standard jelly doughnuts.

This place is definitely more about the idea/concept rather than the actual doughnut itself for me. They don't have a unique quality to the base and depend on the overload of toppings to mask it.

It all started with the long line. It was like waiting to get into a nightclub. Once we got up to the front, we saw the sign that said ""Cash Only,"" but also saw one that stated that they had an ATM inside. Okay, cool. As we walked in (after waiting in line for 20+ minutes), we were informed by another customer that the ATM was broken. Apparently, they felt no need to inform us with a sign in the window. So my fiance headed across the alley to find another ATM as I walked up to the counter. I asked the cashier if I could place my order while my fiance grabbed the cash, and she literally stood there and stared me dead in the eye, silent and obviously not happy, for a good five seconds. Then she said, ""Okay, fine,"" and was bitchy the whole time. My fiance was back in less time than it took for me to place our order, and even he noticed her crappy attitude. I wanted so badly to throw attitude back at her, which I would have done under any other circumstance, but I felt it would be a shame to waste all the time we spent in line. The donuts themselves are nothing special, though the chocolate frosting was pretty good. Also, they don't have bottled or even refrigerated water...you pay ten cents for a cup, and get your water from a giant plastic bucket that has been sitting there for who knows how long.

They were both dry and cheaply flavored. It just seemed that while they might be OK right out of the fryer, anytime after, they just don't hold up. At my favorite donut shop in SF (Bob's Donuts), you can literally eat their donuts at any time of the day and they are delicious.  Also, they way to f'ing expensive for a donut that tastes so dry.

I'm not jaded but I don't see the big deal here.  I've tried 7 or 8 different doughnuts from the VooDoo Dozen and they are more or less made from two or three base doughnut recipes with different toppings. All things considered, only a very small portion of their menu is that creative and unique tasting.  Otherwise it's just a different flavored icing (and the flavor isn't that strong) with some different types of sprinkles.  So I'd recommend avoiding the tempatation to get the $9.95 Basic Dozen or $13 VooDoo dozen and choose your doughnuts individually and carefully.  You'll have plenty of time to decide standing in the ridiculously long line for a half hour or up to an hour depending on day and time.

So we came pretty late in the afternoon to check the place out. The line was not that bad from what I was told and to be honest it moved pretty dang fast. So we got in and all the pressure of a first time hit me.  What do I get? What is good? How many should I get? Should I get one of each? 

So here is what I got, the Old Dirty Bastard, Butterfinger Donut and a Blueberry. So the verdict? I enjoyed them...but it didn't blow my freaking face off. In fact, it was almost too sweet. I know donuts are supposed to be sweet but man it was a lot to in \take and I hate each donut spread through out the day.  I liked the Butterfinger but there was a marshmallow fluff underneath that kind of threw it off. The ODB was just out of control, good but just out of control. 

If you are in town visiting Portland, you kind of have to come here. Its a right of passage just to say you did it. Would I go back? Sure I would, but I am not gonna wait more than 20 minutes for one. Im sure they have better donuts than what I got and maybe I got the wrong thing. But overall they were decent. Place has a lot of hype built around it and rightfully so, visually the donuts and the place is awesome. Not to sure about their beer collaborations with Rougue though.

After spending 5 days in Portland, I am convinced that Portland folks are much friendlier and nice than Californians. Came here at 2am in the morning on my last day in Portland to try the famous donuts. I've had them before by virtue of co-workers bringing them back on their morning flights out of Portland to Los Angeles and thought they were okay but the ideas they come up with are interesting. 

I was short on cash but the host was gracious in offering me a few free donuts to try out after making my first selections as I had waited in line for quite a while. I was very appreciative of that. As for the donuts, eat them when they are fresh. The apple fritter was my favorite and flavorful. Donuts were great, but I wouldn't say they were SPECTACULAR. Just creative and on par with my expectations. Taking a pink box full of these bad boys did turn a lot of heads at the airport though and even got me through security super fast.

The old man and I made a special stop in Portland on the way since we'd seen this place on the food network and aforementioned man was pretty excited about the combinations of bacon, coco puffs, peanut butter, and mango he could get on fried dough. We waited in the cold line that stretched around the corner of the building, looking on yelp for what doughnut we should order once we got inside. 

Now, I should mention that I'm not really adventurous when it comes to doughnuts. I don't like peanut butter, jelly filled (when the jelly-dough ratio is too skewed in the jelly direction) or maple flavored doughnuts. So the ""quirky"" factor of this place is mostly lost on me. I do appreciate a good doughnut, but I don't need all the fanfare. When we finally got inside the front door, I really liked the way they had decorated the maybe 8'x10' ordering area - the art was funky and not your average doughnut shop decor. But when we got to the counter, the girl taking orders was really brusque. I get it, when you have to deal with hundreds of people shoving their way to your counter for 8 hours of the day, you're probably gonna be a little snotty. But this had more the vibe of someone who felt like I should have had the menu memorized, even though most of the ingredients weren't listed under the doughnut names on the tiny-printed menu above the counter. Sorry I didn't research the formula of the Memphis Mafia before I made the trip! I felt rushed and unsure of what to order, so I ended up getting just a plain chocolate glazed. Lame.

The doughnut was okay, a little stale. My boyfriend's Triple Chocolate Penetration had really stale coco puffs on top, but that didn't stop him from scarfing it down. All in all, it was a decent place for doughnuts, probably better if your tastes call for marshmallow glaze and froot loops. For me, I'll save the 10 hour drive and stick to Stan's.",2010-02-18 19:09:31

The line is usually pretty long but it moves quickly. When we arrived, the line had about ~25 people outside and another 15 inside. The wait to order was only 15 mins. There were two people taking orders. 

If you've never been here before, you should probably do a bit of research because they don't really have normal flavors -- that's sort of the point. There's a big sign on the outside wall with the unusual names but it's not really self-explanatory. You can ask questions when you get inside but it's a little uncomfortable to hold up the line with so many people waiting.

There are two versions of donuts; so-called ""raised yeast"" and cake donuts. We tried four donuts:

* Triple chocolate 
Cocopuff cereal and chocolate drizzle on a chocolate cake donuts. This was my least favorite. I scraped off the cocopuffs. The donut itself is moist but I like raised yeast better. 

* Maple Bar 
Raised yeast doughnut with maple frosting. Pretty good but not the best maple bar I've ever had. 

* Portland Cream
Raised yeast shell filled with Bavarian cream topped with chocolate and two eyeballs. This was an enjoyable combination of flavors. 

* Guava colada 
Shredded coconut on a raised yeast donut with a guava/raspberry filling. Served with a umbrella. Sugary goodness without being over the top. The unexpected winner and only donut worth going back for. 

I did some research afterwards (reminder -- do it beforehand) and decided we should have gotten the Memphis Mafia. It's fried dough with banana chunks and cinnamon covered in glaze, drizzled in chocolate and peanut butter with peanuts and chocolate chips on top. Wow! It's also $6.

1. They are a sugary nightmare or a sugary dream depending on how you see it.  Most of the donuts are overly sweet.  While unique and often tasty, the sheer amount of sugar can send anyone's sugar levels off the chart.

2. They do not accept debit/credit cards.  I get it, you pay a transaction fee as a business everytime someone swipes their card, but by not accepting cards you basically force the poor out of towner who has never been to your shop to pay an ATM fee so they can try your donuts.  Thats bad business in my opinion.  There are great solutions like Square that charge 2.75% per swipe.  So that $3 that your customer just bought with their credit card, you lost 8 cents.  Where with your ATM, if you get half the fees back that it charges the customer, you just made an additional $1.25 on that $3 donut.  Again bad business.

3.  To go along with the extra money that you are extracting from customers who do not bring cash, the donuts here are not cheap.  If you try to chose your own dozen, expect to pay at least $20.

I walk in to a ""cash only"" sign, which to me is a huge turn-off.

That's definitely not a great way to start off an experience before even ordering.

Since it just my one stomach, I modestly got 1 donut, the Voodoo Man.

This donut makes for great pictures, since each of them have a different expression but all have a heart with a pretzel stick to stab with. I had fun stabbing the donut until it bled it's raspberry jelly blood. :D 

The flavor itself wasn't anything too memorable, it was just the fun factor that amped it up. All of their donuts have fun/tongue-in-cheek names with some pretty wild flavor combinations.

TL;DR: CASH ONLY, great doughnut variety, little under the hype

Ah yes, the Portland spot that almost everyone talks about. I couldn't ask anyone for suggestions without hearing about this donut place. Voodoo Doughnuts does have a lot of hype and the variety to back it up. However, I didn't find their doughnuts to be too out of the ordinary. Yes, I'm glad I went here, but I'm not sure it's something I'd go out of my way for.

I had the Portland Cream and the Viscous Hibiscus.

PORTLAND CREAM (4/5)
- Good filling, but not too filled
- Average chocolate doughnut taste
- Pretty good size for the price

VISCOUS HIBISCUS (3/5)
- Really sweet, but I don't know what else to expect
- Half sprinkles looks good, but kinda awkward to eat
- Huge doughnut!

I was a huge fan of the service! Even with the line, the cashier was really helpful and explained some of the doughnuts. We were able to order our doughnuts and get out of the store pretty quickly. We didn't know that this shop was Cash Only, but luckily, I had some cash on me. Important to know before you come. I think the novelty of this place is great, but I'm not sure I'd come back again. A good experience for a vacation, though!",2018-03-31 05:10:56

They have an eclectic collection of decorations inside, the exterior brick is painted a sparkly gold color, the employees all seem pretty hip, and they always seem to have pretty cool music playing. I enjoy the variety of donuts here. My favorites are the mango donut and the bacon maple bar. The mango donut doesn't taste like it has real fruit in it but I'm honestly OK with that because it's so amazing! Besides, how healthy can you expect to be while eating a freaking donut?? I love how thick the bacon is sliced on their maple bar. Other bakeries tend to skimp on this so you don't get the contrast between sweet and salty like you do here.

Dislikes: I feel like the donuts at voodoo are pretty basic. In other words, they don't use many unique or creative flavorings. They just load their donuts up with a ton of sugar and food coloring. I would love to see some Cronut, turnoand flakier pastries here. Also, I feel like their donuts are a bit overpriced for what you get.

It was shocking to see the horrible wait line with around 100 people ahead of us. Because of the hype we decided to wait and trust it was the longest wait ever because the queue was hardly moving. Finally we got into the store were there was plenty of varieties to select from. We selected a few and then the next bummer was that they take ONLY CASH. Oh Gawd pleaseee don't want to get out of the line and start from 100 again. Luckily we had a $20 bill using which we got the donuts. When it comes to taste, I would say it was decent but definitely not worth the Hype. Another major problem here is the Parking. Because this place is always having the long queue, finding a parking is almost impossible. Personally I felt the Sunrise Donuts in Redmond tasted better than the VooDoo Donuts.

VD is one of those ""Tourist Traps"" not because this location is small... well that's part of it, but seriously their line stretches down several blocks so visitors can get a taste of those deep fried delights that seemingly defy convention with quirky names like ""The Blunt,"" The Eminem,"" Cock n Balls,"" The Memphis Mafia,"" The Orangutang,"" Bacon Maple Bar,"" Triple Chocolate Penetration,"" ODB,"" the famous Voodoo Doughnut,"" The Grape Ape,"" or the Miami Vice"" to name just a few.

One because the size was so immense, but two because it kind of lacked any sort of assertive flavors. It sounds like this Elvis inspired doughnut would have been amazing, but not so much. I was more than underwhelmed. The person that joined me cracked me up by just having a regular frosted doughnut! She had me in tears more so than the thought of Hion cramming the shaft of the Cock n Balls in his mouth! So are their ridiculously long lines worth coming here? This guy says no way. Trust me when I say if you're going to make a stop by to a Voodoo location then go to their Davis location Voodoo Doughnuts Too. It's still cash only, but the venue is much larger, has plenty of parking, is less crowded, and features much more (indoor) seating and Pinball Machines!: http://www.yelp.com/biz/voodoo-doughnut-too-portland

Like I said though... this location is pretty tiny so there are no indoor tables at all (space would be way too cramped ya know and they could probably only fit like maybe one table if they were lucky.

They sell T Shirts, Sweat Shirts, Stickers, and Post Cards if you want to commemorate your visit.

Parking can be found with great challenge on any of the nearby streets.

Leave your cards at home Party Peeps cuz this place is CASH ONLY! Be wary... you will pay a premium on those fancier doughnuts.",2013-07-31 08:54:48

Very cute, fun donut shop with a rock and roll theme. These donuts follow the ""Keep Portland Weird"" motto very well. All the donuts were pretty crazy, made with many different colored icings, cookies, cereals, candies, etc. To the point where it looks pretty unappetizing. Haha!

They have a Jones soda fountain! Never seen that before, so dope! I was all about the green apple jones growing up! Ahhh, the memories it brought me right when I saw it!

My Son and I were at the Portland Saturday Market mid-morning and as the Voodoo Doughnut line was only on the inside of their establishment.  Please note the ATM in the alleyway, as this place remains a cash business. 

The Kid went for 2 types of specialty donuts (Grape Ape and Orangatang) and loved them. I ordered the relatively mundane chocolate old fashioned as I wanted to see what Voodoo could do with the basics. What I found was that like specialty coffee drinks, fancy sugary treats on top of a doughnut often dramatically improves off the average basics below.

I also noted that all the 5 star reviews of Voo Doo donuts originate from locals that live in the Portland area. As if they have all been collectively brainwashed to gravitate towards this place come rain or shine. 

We waiting for about 20 minutes to actually get up to the counter and as we were waiting we heard one of the employees tell a customer "" I don't give a sh*t if you take an hour to select your donuts, these people can wait here forever for all I care"" . Excellent, I thought! 

When we finally got to the register, we selected 8 of their most popular donuts including the one with bacon. The donuts were good but NOT worth standing in line for so long. And definitely not worth $2.50 a piece. 

Additionally, the bakery and premises were absolutely filthy. The employees were filthy. None of them were wearing hairnets or gloves. The girl who served us looked like she hadn't bathed in days.

Unfortunately, because the line is so long and I could see the menu until it was time to order, I felt great pressure and wasn't able to really see what the shop had to offer. I ordered what I knew, a chocolate bar, bacon maple bar and couple of glazed doughnuts. 

Because we just finished breakfast and were headed back to Seattle, we waited until we got home to eat our treats. The doughnuts were good although I wouldn't say anything special, I have had better. I am a fan of Frost Doughnuts in Mill Creek, north of Seattle. The glazed doughnuts were a loss as they were wrapped in wax paper, which stuck to the doughnuts and was impossible to completely remove.

If I were to visit Voodoo again, I would check the menu online first, as one will not have time to make a decision without annoying everyone in line as well as the staff.

Naturally, as a first time visitor to Portland, I came here.

I bought two donuts but only ended up finishing one because I didn't really think they were that good. 

There are a lot of really good donut places in Portland. Voodoo just happens to be on everyone's lists because of how quirky a lot of the flavors are. But if I'm going to be perfectly honest, some of the toppings are so overwhelming (like having candy or really sweet cereal on top) that it actually stops you from enjoying what the donut is. Also, no amount of coffee or beverage will be able to save you from how sweet these donuts are.

And don't get me wrong...I love doughnuts. I've eaten a lot of them over the years, as my waistline will attest. I've also eaten them in multiple states and in multiple countries. But...I am a Portlander...born and raised. Alas I never discovered Voodoo when it was a little, small bakery. I found it after the behemoth it has become today. Maybe, as some have attested, it was a great shop back in the day. I can only judge it by the experience I had now.

I come from doughnut loving parents. I, for a time, lived next to a donut shop owned by a little old lady from Guam. It was a little hole in the wall, but her donut bakery made some amazing old school donuts. He would allow me to pop in just after he filled the case and grab a few. Oh those maple bars, old fashioned...the list goes on. Yummy. They were so good they even survived a Krispy Kreme opening literally across the street. 

One night my parents and I decided to venture downtown, late, and try Voodoo. The line wasn't too bad...and we ordered up a pink box filled with a dozen of the various kinds they had so we could sample all the creatively topped treats. The first thing that burned in my memory of my first experience there...the staff were less than friendly. Now perhaps this is part of the whole ""punk"" vibe the place goes for...but honestly...there is no place for unfriendly or poor customer service E V E R in a public facing business. This attitude extended to even the person's placement of our donuts in the box. Normally one carefully arranged and places the donuts so they don't get mashed or messed up. You'd think this would be even more so important for a place known for his toppings. Well our donuts were basically just tossed in the box....so much so they were a damn mess when we got them home. And no, I was careful with the box...they are donuts, its sacrilege not to be. ;-)

Once home we went into sampling what we got. Now, like most situations, when something is great it can overshadow waiting or poor service or many things. But when you venture through all that and the end result makes you go ""WTF?"" It really makes the whole thing sink. First, I have to say...before you go all nuts on your toppings, designs, etc....you have to have a solid foundation...in this case a solid donut. To me Voodoo fails at this necessary principle. The donuts themselves were old and stale. Like we were subjected to day or two old donuts. No amount of toppings were going to change that. Out of 12 offerings I cannot tell you a single one that was memorable. Not 1. And everyone involved in this adventure felt the exact same way. The toppings should be enhancing an already great donut. Yet in this case, it seems it's all novelty and no substance. In some ways it felt like the toppings were masking a lousy donut. 

Fortunately I discovered a true gem of the area long after my unpleasant experience at Voodoo. A true NW hole in the wall donut shop in Vancouver called Donut Nook. The place looks like you have time travelled when you walk in...but it's funky and inviting. The staff warm and friendly. And the donuts? Well that's the best part. While you won't get Captain Crunch mashed on them or one shaped like a penis with cough syrup drenched on top....you will get some fresh...amazingly flavor-filled donuts here. Ones we easily go back to and talk about all the time.

The line was short, so the Jen W. and I decided to beeline for it. Standing there, it reminded me of a chinese bakery where the fruitcakes just sit in the center of the store between the cashiers and spin in circles. The donuts were doing the exactly same thing, on a platter spinning and spinning. The decor was pink inside that screamed look at me and give yourself a headache. 

I was really thrown off by the LACK of service here. There were no signs as to what they offered, or what each of the donuts on display was. The girl helping us was in no mood to and we were just trying to find out what's good in the hood. We asked for their ""famous"" donut and she suggested the Maple Bacon- and so we did. Not impressed because I don't care for donuts like that, bacon was dried and fried to an ashy crisp, and the donut wasn't even fluffy on the inside. 

The hype lacked realness and it's really for the pictures. I mean they looked better than they tasted. I wouldn't waste my time through TSA to bring you back VD's.

The interior is very doughnut themed kitschy, filled with branded (and somewhat overpriced) merchandise and, of course, doughnuts. 

We were buying for ourselves and friends so we opted for two dozen mixed (their pick). Our server gave us a good combination (though mainly the cheaper options, as I suppose is to be expected). They were very tasty and stylish - with interesting options that offer a nice bite. Would I say that they blew my mind? No. I'd probably prefer a Krispy Kreme, to be frank.

-A strip club located next door
-Crowds of homeless begging for money steps from the entrance
-Cash only accepted 

Cash only is fine by me. I am used to that craziness. 

But, can I munch on a doughnut and cup of coffee without being asked for money & having my offering of food turned down by the homeless (it was excessive)? Or having them scream at customers through the windows?

Supposedly this is the spot where out of town visitors HAVE to check out before they leave Portland. From what I hear, Voodoo Doughnut is splattered all over the Food Network on various shows. 

The line was about a solid 20-25 minute to just get into the store. Keep in mind that there is a line inside the store but isn't long because the store itself is quite small. Does anyone notice the XXX raunchy theatre next door? I was just standing there in line, trying to find some shade when I look up and the sign reads, ""Hentai"" on such and such days/times. Funny, I didn't over hear anyone else in line say a thing about this theatre. I even saw some dude come out of there and he had the ""You didn't see me!"" look on his face.

Eventually, we finally got into the place and it's only about 1-2pm now. At this point of time, I tell my friend to get me the maple bacon bar since that's what everyone raves about. I had to rush out to the car because our parking time limit was running out. The parking nazi was walking around and handing out tickets with a smirk. ""I gotta go check that biznatch! Maple bacon bar please! See you at the car."" and so I jam.

My friend comes out with that noticeable pink doughnut box but I noticed her grim face right away. The words I didn't want to hear was spoken, ""They ran out of the maple bacon bar."" WTF??? It's only 2pm and you're out of it already! Granted, it's damn popular but that sucks. I settled with the powdered rasberry filled doughnut that tasted like any other Cambodian doughnut shop in So Cali. She got the c*ck & balls doughnut for her friend which was for her bday. That's always a good laugh (picture to come). Had to be a huge chocolate one too.

While I am not a doughnut fan to begin with, Voodoo just doesn't do it for me.  Big props on pushing the envelope with creative and quirky flavor combos (with names to match) - NOTE: bacon on a doughnut should be a standard around the country.

The kids got a sprinkle doughnut and the m&m doughnut. My oldest kid finished her sprinkle doughnut. But my younger ones didn't really like theirs and only ate a few bites.  My wife got the maple bacon doughnut and thought it was really good.

I'm going to take his word for it.

We also got the cocoa-puff covered chocolate cake doughnut. Sadly, I have to say that my love for Voodoo right about died right there. The cocoa puffs were extremely stale, and the cake doughnut was extremely sub-par. We ended up throwing it away.

Below are some of reasons why this place is REALLY hyped up:

* During the first couple of months when Voodoo Doughnut just started (2003), they actually sold NyQuil Glazed doughnut and Vanilla Pepto Crushed Tums doughnut. Well both doughnuts got FDA's attention and FDA told them to stop making doughnut filled with OTC drugs.

* Back in 2011, they made the World's Largest Box of Doughnuts (http://voodoodoughnut.com/blogging/voodoo-doughnut-makes-worlds-largest-box-of-doughnuts/).

* Voodoo Doughnut appeared in Anthony Bourdain's ""No Reservations"" & Season 1 of ""Man vs Food"".

* You can also cater and request for a legal wedding ceremony at the selective Voodoo Doughnut locations (host up to 9 people at this original Voodoo location for $300).

* Weird doughnuts (e.g. doughnut shaped like a vodoo doll [Voodoo Doll doughnut], doughnut shaped like a certain organ of the male reproductive system [Cock-N-Balls doughnut], etc).

I came here pretty early and there was already a line formed at 7:30 AM. This is pretty much a grab-and-go doughnut shop with few picnic tables located just outside of the shop. If you really like this place and want to buy some gifts, then they also sell souvenirs like baseball tees, water bottles, hoodies, baseball caps, beanies, and panties. Yes I said it ... panties.

***

Captain My Captain ($1.75): Basically a Cap'n Crunch cereal donut ... most specifically, a cold donut covered with a fairly sweet layer of white sugar coating. Too sweet for my taste. (2/5)

Bacon maple bar ($3): This donut is their best seller. Just like Captain My Captain, it also tasted cold ... just think of a maple bar slapped with two pieces of cold bacon. Still tasted slightly sweet, but bacon maple bar was slightly better than Captain My Captain. Cold donuts just don't taste good. (2.5/5)

Count me out ... I am not a fan of Voodoo Doughnut and I personally like Blue Star Donuts a bit better (most Blue Star Donuts are not as sweet as Voodoo's).

P.S. - Soon Voodoo Doughnut will be opening up their first LA shop located in the Universal CityWalk (http://www.latimes.com/food/dailydish/la-dd-voodoo-doughnuts-bierbeisl-cleo-20160516-snap-story.html).",2016-11-20 21:48:46

While visiting Portland I knew I had to stop in and check this place out. I heard amazing things.. did they ring true? For the most part.

Here's what I knew to expect:
The place was covered with strange art, visited by tourists from all over, and most importantly, the donuts were ""weird"".  (Thanks Food Network!)

Here's what I found upon going there:
Most people ARE tourists. This place isn't quite special enough to warrant a return visit unless you're bringing a Voodoo Doughnut virgin. The line is long and when you finally get up to order you can't decide what you want. NOT because everything looks delicious though. Much to my dismay, I thought a lot of the choices were too weird.. almost weird JUST to get attention. (This is coming from someone who eats bull penis, alligator, bone marrow, frog's legs, you name it..I'll eat it!). But c'mon... TANG sprinkled on a donut? Some of the ideas are original.. some are just stupid and barely edible. 

In summation I recommend you visit this place if you're visiting Portland. It's a Top 10 ""must-see"" but don't expect to get the best donut of your life. (You can get THAT in Seattle at Top Pot). The donuts are odd and funny to take photos of but it pretty much ends there. If I lived a block away from it I'd still probably make it over there once a year when someone was visiting and I had to take them to the touristy spots. Other than that.... yeah - total miss.

I recall walking into this tiny hole in the wall dump next to an equally dumpy adult only theater about five or six years ago and there was maybe two people in the joint.  One of my son's said he heard they had a maple bar with bacon on it and I thought why in the hell on earth would I want to put something like that into my mouth?  I ordered something I could relate to, he had the sugared pork.  

I may have been back one time since as frankly it's a doughnut shop for god sake; it's not some ancient monument like Stonehenge or the Pyramid of Giza, but passing by there today you will see lines of people longer than what you will ever see at the Museum.

I travel a bit and it is not uncommon to see people at the airport waiting at the gate holding a box of Voodoo doughnuts to take thousands of miles away!   I tell you the owners must practice Voodoo and they turn people into zombies who eat only doughnuts or something.  I want to learn how to market a product that has lost all of its appeal from decades of ""it's time to make the doughnuts"" to driving people to come from every continent to stand in line for the same boiled in oil, sugar coated dough ball that is available in every city in America sans Bacon.

I liked the maple bacon donut the best since it's a classic combination, the others seemed like forced novelty. 

Breakfast cereal on a donut sounds like a good idea, but is there anyone who can eat cap'n crunch without letting it soften in milk at least a little first? I was terrified for the roof of my mouth and my teeth. Some of them, like the cock and balls are funny renditions on classic donuts, but the thing is that they're mostly very sweet and if I'm willing to do without some novelty I can stop at nearly any other donut place on the west coast, (yeah, I had to specify west coast, I don't think NYC would know a decent donut if it slashed their tires), preferably run by vietnamese people and get something better, without standing in line.

So yeah, worth it once, for the novelty, and maybe if you're in the area and want a snack and there's no line then it might also be worth a stop.

I heard this was the place to go when in Portland, so I decided to check it out. I did my research too--made sure to get cash (who carries cash nowadays??) and was prepared to stand in a ridiculously long line.

After being accosted by several homeless people (probably because they knew you had to have cash on you to go to Voodoo), I arrived at the historic site. Luckily, there was barely a line and only had to wait a few minutes...inside (it was raining, so I was grateful for that). The variety can be overwhelming; I didn't know which one to choose. But as a sucker for anything with peanut butter, I opted for one with peanut butter drizzled on top. I was super excited as I sat down to eat outside the shop (again, approached by more homeless people). I have to say that the doughnut did not taste fresh or warm...it was hard to get down.

It is on television, celebrities have endorsed it...sheesh, how else could this place be advertised? Jesus coming down from heaven and personally blessing the place? Jokes aside, I decided to see what the hype was about...and found out that it's just that, hype. 

After waiting over fifteen minutes (only three people in front of me. But the hipster clerk wouldn't let anyone else pay until a customer used the ATM to get cash), I finally ordered my two doughnuts (bacon maple bar, and regular maple bar), and payed almost five bucks(!) for the two. Now that should have payed for two doughnuts, plus coffee at any other place, but I figured that the doughnuts should be good enough, right? Not quite.

Simply put, the doughnuts were nasty. The bacon tasted old, and the icing was way, way too sweet. To the point where I felt like vomiting afterwards. I couldn't even finish the second doughnut, because the sweetness was just killer. Some of you may think I am a wuss...but come on, try it yourself and see. I'd like to see you choke down two of the maple bars. And if you do...join the forces of Wilford Brimley in fighting diabeetus. 

As mentioned earlier, the smarmy hipster clerk just pissed me off. She had this air of superiority around her, like if she didn't exist, the whole place would fall apart. There was another hipster behind the counter, who did not open up a second register to help out the long line, and seemed to just sit and stare into space. What was his job? I honestly don't know. 

I don't understand the shit-craze everybody has for Voodoo. Everyone makes it sound like it's super original and trendy, but in all truth the doughnuts are sub-par and pricey. Clerks are super rude, they only take cash, the lines are long...and just the simple fact that it's overrated. It is just like those cupcake places that have sprung up in every metropolitan area.

As far as freshness goes, these were great. We bought them in the afternoon; they were great that night, and they were still great the next morning. 

Voodoo Doll: The only complaint I heard about this one was that there was jelly in only 1/3 of it. 
Captain My Captain (Cap'n Crunch): A no-repeater; the cereal gets sort of soft and pliable from absorbing the doughnut's icing. (I would assume the same for the ones with Cocoa Puffs and Fruit Loops on top.)
Mexican Hot Chocolate: A chocolate doughnut dusted in cinnamon, sugar and cayenne pepper. I like chocolate with a little cayenne, but this was more than a little cayenne. I couldn't eat it.
Butterfingerling: Topped with crushed Butterfingers. Love. This was awesome.
Maple Bacon Bar: Loved even more. This one is the reason to go. But in the future, I will probably just buy a maple bar at Albertson's and put bacon on it myself.

Take this review with the understanding that Krispy Kreme Doughnuts actually hurt my teeth. Also understand that I have a major sweet tooth, so for something to be too sweet, I feel that it has to be 110% sugar. Because that percentage is possible in the realm of my reviews.

I didn't try the bacon one and maybe I should have. Bacon equals heaven. The voodoo man doughnut was actually the perfect amount of sweetness, but the jelly filling was too much a giant glob of jam in my mouth all at once. I would have enjoyed it much much more had the filling been spread throughout the whole of the doughnut rather than just in the ""butt.""

I made the mistake of buying a huge pink box full of these things and wound up giving them away to someone else who wound up not being a fan. Frowny face.

The only reason this place remains popular is because of their unique flavors and the emergence of modern social media. While most won't admit it, going to Voodoo focuses on taking pictures and spreading them on social media, rather than judging the quality and flavor of the donuts.

This place is very nearly the equivalent of an edible museum. Have you ever wondered what the Mona Lisa painting tasted like? No, and you shouldn't, because that's weird. Some of their flavors are unique, and maybe one out of 30 actually tastes good. But to compare their basic flavors to other places, I'm underwhelmed. 

Don't be fooled by the fad. Eat the donuts for what they are, and judge accordingly. Once you've done so, I think you'll agree that this place is overrated. In all honesty, this place is average, and probably deserves a 3-star rating. But to compensate for the influx of misleading high reviews, I'm obliged to give a 1-star rating.

On a side note, I wouldn't consider this place family friendly. Some of their creations can be dark and sexual in nature. Just a heads up.",2015-04-11 20:29:49

I waited in line for half on hour, took a crazy amount of pictures of the sign outside, the glittery wall, the musicians playing on the corner, the ""Keep Portland Weird"" mural across the street... As for the donut, it's ok. It's just a donut, nothing fancy. I was a little disappointed in the design, it didn't look like the one in the pictures and the sign outside, but they did draw a nice fetus on it which made me happy. The girl taking my order was a little rude. I was wondering if they had a donut design similar to one in the display cause, and she looked at me like I was speaking in Piglatin.

The quality of the thing you're going there for isn't anything special.  It's an okay doughnut with different things on top.  Half the time, the things I get on top of them are stale.  Nothing worse on a doughnut than cereal or Oreos that taste like they've been sitting out on the counter all day (because they have?).

I will not make a special trip to go back.  Here are the positives.  It is a donut shop and they make pretty good doughnuts overall.  The selection is ""obscene"" in more ways than one!  Who needs such a selection?  Tourists, I suppose.  Serious donut eaters do not need this kind of place.  The service is good!  Every cash register was open, and although there was a line, people were be being served quickly, efficiently, and by people who were seemed knowledgable.  That's it for the positives.  Here are the negatives:  1. Severely over priced.  Their maple/bacon bar, a legend for them, is $3 each!.  Most donuts are above $1 each and I'd say the average price is about $2 each.  We bought 4 donuts and it cost us $7.15.  2.  No parking.  This place is in an urban area so parking is sparse.  We lucked out and found one nearby, but we had to put money in a meter to pay for the space, so no bargain there.  3.  Homeless person begging at the front door is a nuisance.  We gave him money, but come on, do we really need this at the front entrance?  4. No tables inside.  The only tables are outside (it was raining, as usual this time of year) and they are surrounded by homeless types, etc.  So, in summary, if you are a local, pass this place up.  The doughnuts are not so good that you need to go through the hassle at this cramped location in a less than desirable spot in downtown Portland.

I went on a Tuesday morning, around 9am - very short line, guess that's a good time to go. Parking was open, too.

Obviously the maple bacon donut was going to be purchased for my group of buddies but the question was which other ones to get. After some help from one of the friendly, not condescending, staff members, I made my selection:

-Maple Bacon Doughnut - coming from LA, the land of two very good maple bacon doughnuts (Huckleberry & Nickel Diner), I had high expectations for this. Unlike the aforementioned eateries, Voodoo's doughnut has two WHOLE strips of bacon on it's long, maple-coated eclair shaped doughnut. No hole in this guy. The bacon was sweet and the maple frosting was a good accompaniment. But this was a big mamma-jamma, and I had to split it with friends

-Chocolate peanut butter donut - this was great, for a bite. I don't know how anyone can finish one of these unless they are on an MDMA rush and haven't eaten in weeks. It was super sweet, yet super decadent. A chocolate fantasy - that you can't turn off.

-Cotton Candy doughnut - this was the true mouth rappage of them all. The doughnut tasted like cotton candy (I believe it was coated in cotton candy granulated sugars), and was the most fluorescent blue you will ever see while not on a hallucinogen.  But MAN was it SWEET! It was like getting your cavity filled with sucrose.

A fun, and novel place but beware of the sugar rush!

It was brightly colored with lots of photos on the wall and had a cool chandelier type light.  By the time we got up to the spot to order we had already made our selections long before.

When I was visiting Portland everyone was telling me to try this place because it had the best donuts ever. I was little skeptical because I'm from LA and NOTHING beats the food or desserts out there. 

So after dinner, we decided to walk over to this joint located near Chinatown. This place is CASH ONLY. I'm not sure if the other place is cash only as well, but the voodoo doughnuts in Chinatown was so that was a bummer. They have an ATM machine inside so you're in luck if you don't have cash. 

The venue is SMALL, and dirty as hell. Actually, the surrounding area of the venue seemed like your typical LA skid row type of area so if you're feeling something nicer, maybe you should head to the other one somewhere in Portland. 

We ordered half a dozen donuts, and it came out to be 10 bucks? It's pretty pricey for donuts but since it's a popular joint I guess they can hike up the dollar amount. They're also popular for their vegan options but we didn't have any of that. 

In all honesty, this place is all hype. I'm not sure where the hype stemmed from but gotta give it up to their marketing skills. It tastes like any other donut joint but more expensive. 

But when in Portland, it's always good to visit their most famed donut shop at least once. Probably won't come here again if I head up to Portland again.

VERDICT: The doughnuts were pretty good (taste, texture). The voodoo doughnut was pretty good with the jelly filled center and the oreo encrusted one was pretty good too.

I've heard the story so many times. Your founders got high and walked around a grocery store and came up with your doughnut ideas.

Their silly little doughnut shop now lives at the heart of Portland's tourism industry. A cheap product that can be made in mass and delivered to a cheap consumer. The McDonald's of bakeries. It's a win-win situation for anyone hoping to consume 500 calories for under $1.

I hate the way that everyone who visits me in this city insists on going to Voodoo while they're in town, and how I have to stand there with my rolling eyes and crossed arms and pretend to be happy to take them to your establishment. I hate your tired ""pink boxes"" jokes. I hate the way you've made ""maple bacon"" a thing now. I just hate you, and you don't deserve it, but I still hate you.

You get two stars, though, for having an excellent reputation as an employer. You provide those who work for you with a livable wage and health care options. Even though it's one of the busiest food spots in town, your employees always seem to be happy to call Voodoo Doughnuts their place of work. Serious high fives for you.

But your doughnuts are still worse than the ones at Safeway.

Got there @ 10:30 and had to wait in a line for about 15 minutes. If it doubles back on itself count on 30. 

While waiting, you can QR a copy of the menu where you can check out the selection.

CASH ONLY. But you shouldn't be spending more than $30 here anyway or you have a donut problem of Homerian scale.

Inside there's a gorgeous wavy chandelier and the menu with pricing on the wall. Best deal is the cashiers selection of 12 donuts, where they pick 12 random ones for you for $17. 

But if you ask if they picked a specific one for you they will look at you with a glazed look and say ""I'm not sure"".

Just saved you 5 minutes of haggling and you can't be bothered to tell me if you picked a Portland cream? Bought a cream just to find he had picked one.

Save your coffee money and buy at the too cool for school Stumptown branch 3 doors away. Theirs was just not well made. Kids threw theirs away as too acidic.

Nice seating area outside if you are lucky enough to get a table.

Who do they think they are? The Doughnut Nazi's? Only reason we tried this the first time is because I wanted a vegan doughnut while we were visiting. My husband went to pick them up and when he came back he was a little annoyed. The guy behind the counter was super rude and the line was long. I was surprised that my doughnuts weren't that good and he said neither were his non vegan ones. 

We moved to the Portland area and went again recently after a day walking around town and eating Delicious Thai Cart Food (with awesome service). After waiting in a line for about 30 minutes we get up there and there is only one guy doing the cash register and getting the doughnuts. He's got an attitude like he wishes he wasn't there and he's doing us a favor. We order our doughnuts and I have to scrape the frosting off of mine because it is unbearably sweet. 

Then just today I went down there to get three dozen for my daughters bday tomorrow in class. Line was only about three people out the door. Once I got up to the front there I got a blank stare from a skinny chick that could double as a meth head ( I know I'm being mean). I told her I needed three dozen and I swear she rolled her eyes and sighed. I asked if she had a dozen chocolate glazed vegan doughnuts and she looks at me so perturbed and says ""no"". So I said, OK, how much you got. She actually starts getting them and then realizes that she does have them. Then I point to above them and say and ask for a dozen of the plain glazed. She snaps at me ""are they vegan? If they are, you have to tell me or I'm gonna give you non vegan!"" Again, maybe too much meth? It didn't get much better as I picked the remaining. She took my money when I was done and her ""thanks"" was very phony. I walked out of there and swore they would never get any of my money ever again. 

Now I can imagine if their doughnuts were the best around but they are not. My husband gets the non vegan ones and says Krispy Kreme is much better. The vegan ones aren't that great either. Especially the powder. Made me ill. And I just get the feeling that if they are going to treat me that bad when I'm ordering maybe the doughnuts aren't even vegan. Next time I need vegan doughnuts during the week I'm calling a vegan baker and seeing if they can make them for me.

I tried a few of the donuts here to get an idea. You don't really want to eat a lot of them, so I shared them and they lasted a few days. 

The best vegan one I had (which is obviously not healthy) is the one with chocolate icing, oreo cookies and drizzled with peanut butter. It is good, but you probably would only want to eat half of it to avoid the sugar headache! 

I also tried some of the vegan apple fritter, tasted pretty much like an apple fritter. 

I also got a chocolate cake donut and a white cake donut with maple icing. These were ok, they were a little dry and did not taste very fresh. Perhaps fresh would be better. 

I also got a chocolate one filled with vegan vanilla pudding another day, it was pretty good too. 

I went at 11 pm on a Thursday night and it took me about 25 minutes before I could order.

Friday night we went around the same time and it only took a few minutes to get in. 

It's super chaotic there and not very easy to order vegan donuts as you can't see all that they have available, and there are no names. So I had to like describe what kind of donut I was looking for and they quickly try to find what you want. 

Basically don't go expecting any particular donut if you're vegan, it's a random mishmash of what they have, and the later it gets, the less vegan ones they have in stock.

If the place wasn't so dirty and chaotic I would give it more stars. It just isn't a pleasant experience buying from them and not being able to see all of the options and get what you want.

Objective - A doughnut with a side of voodoo

Pro: Solid doughnuts.  Lots of variety.  What can you say?  The voodoo doughnut is just plain fun.

Con: Employees seemed like they wanted nothing more than to be out of the store.  Unhelpful and unpleasant--at least the customer-facing employees were.

Overall: Would recommend to the ""have to try it once because I'm a tourist"" friend.  Be prepared to wait awhile outside.

My Experience: The line doubled back outside of the front door.  After waiting an hour to get inside, we were excited to finally get to the cashier and start picking out some doughnuts.  Here's how our dialogue went:

Us:  ""Hi!""  *smile*  ""How much is the voodoo doll doughnut?""
Them:  *bored, sarcastic, unpleasant* ""It's priced what it is.""
Us:  ""Oh okay, sorry this is our first time here.""
Them:  ""...""
Us:  ""For the voodoo dozen do we get to pick the doughnuts in the dozen?""  
Them:  ""You can pick whatever you want to be in the dozen, but you'll pay for each one of them individually.""
Us:  ""Oh, okay.  So, what's in the dozen then?""
Them:  ""There's some cake, there's some special, there's some normal.""
Us:  ""...Okay, we'll just take a dozen.""
Them:  *proceeds to grab random doughnuts*
Us:  ""Does a voodoo doll doughnut come with the voodoo dozen?""
Them:  ""Yeah.  We can add it on top and you can pay for it.""
Us:  ""Alright.  Let's add one then.  And add a maple bacon too.""

We left far less than satisfied with their customer service.  It felt like they thought we were idiots and were doing us a huge favor.  I guess it's hard to maintain quality when you have employees with a ""I don't care about you at all because I have another hundred customers waiting right behind you"" mentality.",2013-12-28 03:19:50

After waiting in line for 30+ minutes, we ordered a dozen donuts for our family, including two voodoo donuts (apparently their specialty) and a Froot Loops doughnut for our 3-year-old.  After finally ordering our doughnuts (which totaled a, frankly ridiculous, $23), we were pushed on by staff, not giving me a chance to check that the box actually contained what we ordered, which is something I usually make a point of doing.  Upon reaching home, we opened the box to find that the aforementioned three donuts were missing entirely (in spite of us being charged for them).  In addition, the doughnuts we *did* get were dry and boring, in spite of their attractive descriptions on their menu.

Pros: None.  An absolute waste of time and money.  Dunkin' Donuts doesn't exactly peddle high-quality doughnuts, but at least you know what you're getting.  I'd spend $20 at DD before I spent another cent at Voodoo.  Heading to Krispy Kreme tomorrow to get some fairly priced and consistently tasty doughnuts from people who know how to count.

Hrmm..let's see how the donuts fare since the service sucks. 

My orange donut was way too sweet. I felt like I was eating diabetes if that were possible. I was dissatisfied and disgruntled and dis-everything after biting in my doughnut several times. Then I tried the cocoa puffs doughnut...and yum! It was much better and I then though....why did I decide to venture off form the norm. I LOVE chocolate. What made me think I would enjoy a foreign mango jelly and orange tang doughnut???

I didn't try the maple bacon regardless of how many people rant about the thing. it's just a maple doughnut with...bacon on it. wth?

Anyways, once was enough and I went for the novelty experience (which I highly recommend). But it's definitely nothing to rant about....

I waited for about an hour on Sunday afternoon, which wasn't too terrible. A girl in sweats with bright hair was singing to those in line, trying to put her name out there. Just to warn you if she comes back again, she's definitely not as good as she thinks she is...but it made the wait a little more interesting.

When I finally made it in, I ordered 3 doughnuts:
Bacon Maple Bar ($3): arguably the doughnut Voodoo is most famous for. It was delicious, but at the same time, I could have bought a maple doughnut almost anywhere and put a couple of strips of bacon on it and it would have been the same.

Portland Cream ($1.75): I got this since the menu described it as ""Portland's Official Doughnut."" I didn't discern any difference from a Boston Kreme, really. The cream was light and delicious, but the chocolate layer on top proved to be too sweet for me. I had to scrape it off to finish.

Lemon Chantilly Cruller ($1.40): the crullers here are really good. This one was also covered in frosting, but since I saved it for later, most of the frosting came off on the paper I'd wrapped it in. Only then did I think I was good. The actual cruller was light with a perfect texture.

Prices are fair. Not cheap, but not overly expensive.

Overall, I think the doughnuts here have too much frosting. I have a sweet tooth, but even I can't handle it! The doughnuts are good, but not amazing. For the line you wait in, I would like something better. It's considered a Portland institution though, and you can easily tell it's a tourist destination from all the souvenirs they sell inside.

Okay, I guess I'm not all that impressed with the whole Voodoo Doughnut thing on several levels.  I waited in the long line for almost an hour to get a dozen cuz I've never been to Portland before & this is sort of a Portland institution.  I ordered the 'Voodoo Dozen' which means the cashier pics them out.  Some of them are unusual, i.e. a doughnut with oreos sprinkled on it, another with fruitloops on it, etc., but then some of the ones she gave me were just as ordinary as ordinary can be, like a maple bar, and a plain old chocolate covered, plus a few others.  Those weren't 'Voodoo' at all from what I could tell.  One I was hoping the woman would include was the maple bar with bacon strips because I'd read about that one before coming here, but for some odd reason she left that one out in favor of some more ordinary nothing-special doughnuts instead.  I asked her if she could swap one of the ordinary doughnut for it -- she said no, but I could buy it for an additional $2.25, which I did, even though I felt like that was sort of a ripoff.  The doughnuts themselves taste okay as far as doughnuts go, but I wouldn't say they are  anything all that special or spectacular as all the hype & vibe of this place would lead you to believe they are.  They're just doughnuts, some of which have an interesting, unique visual flair.  That said, I was really surprised when she told me they don't take plastic!  This makes NO sense, this is a very popular booming business, it's not like they can't afford the fees of taking plastic (A LOT of other less popular businesses in this area DO take plastic).  She told me I could use their ATM, but I'm sure the fees I get charged for that wouldn't be worth it, however, luckily I had enough cash to pay for them.  Come on Voodoo, this is ridiculous, don't be so damn cheap, take plastic you morons!  IMHO this place is way over hyped for what it is.  I can see how this would be fun for little kids to get some of the unusual doughnuts with cereal or cookies sprinkled on them, so that might be worthwhile under those circumstances, but otherwise Voodoo Doughnuts  really isn't anything all that great.",2013-05-26 21:40:27

The overall experience (funky decor, bright pink boxes, tongue-in-cheek names, gluten-free friendly) is super cool - I think people are right in saying you have to go at least once to get the vibe of it.

I had the Apple Fritter, the Blueberry Cake Donut, the Dirt Donut, and the classic Glazed donut.

obviously, we were expecting really delicious doughnuts, but were totally completely disappointed. i ordered the mexican hot chocolate doughnut, the buttermilk bar, and a couple of cream filled doughnuts, to get a variety. they were out of the gay bar, which i was tremendously saddened by. my anthony-bourdain-fan-fiance got the bacon maple bar (the one he HAD to try), the ODB, and the miami vice something or other. 

i took one bite out of each doughnut, and i was sick to my stomach! it was way too sweet, and it made me crave those hashbrowns we passed at the diner on the way to the park. anyway, we were both disappointed. the pink box was overrated.

Yeah, its not winchells where you can get donuts for $1-2, but we got a Capt Crunch, a Pothole, and a ""large"" coffee for under $6 so I was actually surprised at how affordable it was.  We hit it up around 8AM on a Friday and there were only 4 or 5 people in front of us.  The donuts are in two separate display cases and the menu above doesnt list what is in all of them (or else I didnt notice as the place is trippy) so I wish they had menus.  I can see being really stressed if there are 45 people behind you and after 30 minutes in line you just wanna make sure and order something good and have a few questions.  The capt crunch was tasty...simple but tasty.  I got the pothole so I could try their famous bavarian cream, which was pretty good once I got to it but cream occupied MAYBE 20% of the inside which was severely disappointing.  Speaking of head scratchers, being a DONUT place...in raining PORTLAND no less...can I please get a LARGE cup of coffee?  It wasnt that good either and the coffee station was out of most everything.  Act like you been there before and station one person in line while the other gets coffee across the alley, on the other side of the patioo seating. :) One size which was a standard small-medium cup and as the line built up I wasnt waiting in line for a refill. Anyways, donuts were tasty but nothing earth shattering.  They do use yeast so you get a thick, more hearty donut which personally I enjoyed. A few notes...parking is street.  Avoid the lot across the street if possible.  My total was $2.50 and dude didnt have ANY coin change.  I had 40 cents, so $2.40 and he wouldnt take it. He refused to give me my keys until I went somewhere to get coins...or overpaid.  Shrugged at me like ""hey, what are you going to do clown, I got your keys."" UNREAL.  Speaking of cash, cash only at Voodoo.  They do have an ATM in there but you will get charged $2.75 or so by your bank to use it.  Overall, I'd hit it.  It is a destination, it is reasonably priced, there is always some kind of scene over there, and it was FUN.  That's the name of the game...FUN.

Seriously, waiting in line for 30-60 minutes for mediocre doughnuts is just not the business. If you're at the downtown location anytime at night, expect a throng of drunk people trying like hell to figure what they're going to order, which only slows down the process. Sure, while you wait you can stare at the totally, like, kitschy gaudy decoration and marvel how quirky this doughnut shop is but then after the first 20 minutes of waiting you realize you could be doing much better things with your life like making a sandwich, watching E! News Network or I dunno, getting a doughnut somewhere else. Just some ideas. The doughnuts themselves? Not even that good. They've never tasted fresh and they are definitely NOT worth the wait.

We did split a plain cake doughnut but Voodoo's version was just ok.  Not Top Pot.  We routinely do plain cake and plain old fashioned from TP because they are just right.

It was a little to sweet for my liking and I could have done without the bacon but I still enjoyed it.  The doughnut itself was soft and moist, not doughy.  My friend had the ""No Name"".  I loved it, it was like a different take on a s'more.

I have tried just about every doughnut on the menu and can narrow it down to a top three: The Memphis Mafia, Miami Vice and McMinnville Cream.

VooDoo wins for fun and comfort.

I am not a fan of the super sweet frosting and topping overload but it keeps me from overeating!  These doughnuts are soft, moist and made fresh.  A plus in my book! They also provide a vegan selection.

We were heading back home from a mini vacation but wanted to stop to taste what it seems Yelpers and the Food Network celebrities have said is one of the best doughnuts or as one person said comically the best thing she's put in her mouth. So armed with great expectations and a sweet tooth that make Yogi Bear proud my friend and I buy into it and wait in the long line. 20 minutes later we bought several doughnuts including voodoo, peach fritter, fruit loop, ODB, bacon maple, maple custard, and oreo so we could be fair that if there was one we didn't like there were other options. First, the counter service girl had the personality of a wall. Not friendly, no smile, no personality, and act like we should be honored to have her wait on us. This seems to happen a lot when employees work at a ""tourist hot spot"" and think they are rockstars and service never gets better since they know people will still show up. Second, the actual product... overrated. Voodoo filling was subpar, frosting had a weird flavor, and seemed too doughy. Bacon maple to me had a burnt piece of bacon which took away from the flavor although in concept it should have worked. This was probably my friends best doughnut out of the bunch since she said she likes more crispy bacon, which I countered no there is ""creole"" and there is burnt. Fruit loop was disgusting. Imagine leaving fruit loops out on the counter for 2 weeks then put  on a doughnut with frosting and letting them get soggy. Peach fritter in my opinion had the most potential but had so much frosting it became gross to eat. You had to scrap off 90% just for it to be eatable but once you do it was probably the only doughnut that was decent to me. Maple custard was ""ok"" but not worth the hype. After eating just those doughnuts we had enough and tossed the rest in the trash. 

Overall, this place is not going anywhere since its a tourist place and has some devoted fans but in my opinion this place calling card is more about being weird and a ""i've been there"" kind of place and not so much for quality of doughnuts. I would never come back since I've had better doughnuts without the hype or the weird combinations that with us at least failed on a massive scale.

We had a Portland stop scheduled on our Northwest road trip. This was going to be our first time to the city and this place always came up in search engines for the best  thing to do. Side note: It made me nervous that the biggest highlight of Portland was a donut shop. 

A Saturday was spent mostly trying to avoid beggars and hobos and VooDoo is a hot spot for them. Oh and people were actually willing to wait in line an hour for this stuff. We begged off that day. Tried back Monday morning before driving to Seattle, and it was a 5 minute wait and the hobos were sleeping in. Fun but definitely only worth a short  wait. They make me laugh too, because me and my husband only bought two doughnuts and they offered to give us a fancy box for them instead of a paper bag. I guess that's what all the crazy tourists want and expect after their hour wait so they can post proof on facebook that they actually ate donuts from this place. Of course you need a fancy VooDoo box for that. We took our paper bag and went outside to eat and watch everyone else photograph their doughnut boxes.

Come to think of it, I don't think there was a place to sit - period. This might as well have been a drive-through.

The doughnuts were not great. The one with fruit loops looks interesting but the fruit loops were so stale it was hard to eat it.

So I love Voodoo and I'm totally on the bandwagon with how awesome, funny, and unique it is. However being born and raised in Portland I also have an honest opinion of the place.

The lines are long. Like really long. If you want to stand in line for about an hour in order to receive just an OKAY pastry, this is just your cup of tea. It's funny because the lines never seem to die down. No matter the time. I've been to Voodoo at 2am and I still found myself waiting with a flock to retrieve the almighty sugar bread.

The doughnuts themselves are not the best doughnuts I've ever had. The dough is kind of stale and crunchy, the frosting and fillings hard and cracking. Obviously they have a lot of customers to serve, and thus doughnuts spend a long time out on the shelf during the day. But if I'm going to be waiting in a line for six days, I would like to shove the best doughnut of my life in my gob. You'd just think with all the DOUGH they rake in every day they'd be able to get the doughnut game right.

Tourists are fantastic. They bring a lot of revenue into the city and I appreciate their existence...just not in my vicinity. They are anxious, loud, and crowding up the place, and they're all apparently at Voodoo. 

Cash only. They have an ATM inside if you want to be charged five extra bucks to withdraw cash. 

Parking is a nightmare and to be expected because it's right in the middle of downtown. I recommend just getting to one of the many pay to park parking lots in the area. Or you could drive around the block eight times before finding street parking...to also pay for.

HOWEVER, all that being said, I do recommend you go there at least once if you've never been. It's a cool experience with friendly staff and a very Portland vibe- just be aware of what you're getting into so you're not gravely disappointed. I would also recommend going over to Voodoo Doughnuts Too, because it tends to be a little less crowded and more accessible.",2014-09-05 17:11:19

I like their flair and humor, especially their cocoa puff doughnut which is definitely my fave, but their donuts taste stale sometimes and I've heard from some of the employees that the management isn't too nice to their employees.

i won't lie. their doughnuts are yummy. i prefer starting with a plain ol' glazed doughnut. it's like sampling a cheese pizza to determine if an establishment really makes pizza well. well, they do doughnuts pretty dang well. back home, i get the same kind of stuff at a place called dutchmonkey so the experience is not unique to portland.

Ok, whatever.  If you're going to go to Voodoo then you already know that you're going to go there because it's on your travel itinerary or whatever.  And if you like Voodoo, then you've already convinced yourself that you like it, and I'll acknowledge that quirkiness/attitude/whatever it is that Voodoo has to offer has some kind of value.

Just don't get confused and think that you're going there to experience a doughnut product that tastes in any way special/better than Safeway.

(Also, when I bake a bunch of cookies and I package them in adorable COMPLETELY STANDARD PINK BAKERY BOXES that I got at The Decorette Shop, don't say, ""Oh, you got Voodoo??!!?""  No.  Voodoo does not own the rights to the pink box.  Please.)

If you would like to try a doughnut that has the weird ingredient combos down (minus the occasional phallic inspiration) and is also a well-made doughnut, try Blue Star.  It's expensive, for doughnuts.

If you would like to experience the ultimate doughnut without getting crazy (particularly the doughnut holes, OH MY THE HOLES), head out to Tulip Pastry Shop in St. Johns.  Doughnuts are supposed to have an ultrathin exterior of crisp caramelization, remember?  If you don't remember and can't be bothered to go out to Tulip, then that's on you, but don't complain about how Voodoo was supposed to be the best and failed you, because no.  That is wrong.  You've been warned.

Mango Tango: Very refreshing change from all the chocolates and creams. Mango-flavored on the outside, zesty orange on the inside

Then he asks (outloud) to a co-worker ""am I on break?"" I understand every employee deserves a break, but he made it seem like he didn't even want to assist me. There's one issue. The other issue was due to my inexperience of ordering donuts at Voodoo. First thing i explained to the individual was "" So how does this work?"" Stating the obvious that i have never been there before. He explained they way you could order donuts kind of low mannered and with the same attitude as if he just wanted to get off and go home, which i dont blame him coming from an employee standpoint. Idk if it was just the loud environment, lack of explanation, or my comprehensive undstanding that didnt give me the greatest experience. Therefore I ordered a classic order of donuts, not realizing that classic was literally donuts you could of ordered anywhere at any Joe shmo donut place. To my understanding, I thought classic was considered signature classic voodoo donuts that they have made before since they began, unlike their daily creative donuts.

I love that they have a whole line of vegan donuts, I love the rotating display case, I like the imagination that went in to some of the donuts.

I tried the Boston Cream and the chocolate covered crueller. Both good. My friend tried the maple bacon and she said she liked it, that it was a good balance of bacon and sweet.

Quite frankly, this place is more gimmicky than taste... just interesting names and designs.  The doughnut by itself is no more than mediocre. We tried 3:

(1) Mango Tango - it's way too sweet for my taste... 
(2) Maple Bacon Bar - a bar with maple frosting and 2 small strips of bacon on top. It's something that you can probably assemble yourself and not have to pay $2.75 for it.  anyways, the taste was quite nice... sweet and salty at the same time.. not bad
(3) Voodoo Doll - This is definitely more gimmicky than anything.  The doughnut is in the shape of a doll and filled.  Nothing more.  

One of the touristy things to check off your list.  Otherwise, don't bother waiting in line.

The show is a 10, replete with Disney-length lines on the weekends, the pink boxes, and the huge side-show menu of donut oddities.  A box of a dozen weighs like six boxes of Krispy Kremes, and, to say the least, they are festive.  On a taste level?  They're a mixed bag. 

The lemon filled donuts covered with blue icing, the special, were filled too rapidly and unevenly. Too much bread on one side, too much filling on the other. The filling itself was made hastily, and had a bad gelatin quality to it rather than a gooey lemony wonderfulness for which I think they were shooting. 

The Memphis fritters were overcooked to dry hardness, but the toppings were tasty. It just lacked interior softness to go with the snap of the outside of the fritter. 

The coconut topped donut with the peanut butter in the middle wasn't inherently sweet, so the dollop of unsweetened peanut butter in the middle gave it a doughy peanutty quality that wasn't taste or particularly fun to swallow.  

I'm sure, somewhere back in its foundation, Voodoo executed at five star quality, and the donuts have the potential to be that good again BUT... 

Right now, they're big on attitude and low on quality preparation, so, fun as the 30 minute line to get it was, they were not worth the wait, although we can always hope that someone in the kitchen gives a damn enough to produce quantity AND quality once again.",2014-07-24 03:13:02

Judging from the dreadlocked ginger, dirty hippie girl with ring worm (seriously), obese monstrosities, various speed geekers, aging hipsters, and other creatures occupying the block-long line to get a doughnut at 3:00 p.m. on a Tuesday afternoon, weird is exactly what they're keeping it.

Among the weird was I. I'll admit it, I waited in the ten-plus minute line to try what authors Chuck Palahniuk and Anthony Bourdain once swooned over. It wasn't my choice to go or wait; nevertheless, I was there and I was intrigued. I'm not a big ""sweets guy"" (excuse me while I throw up in my mouth for saying that), but I'm all for decadence, and decadence is definitely what the people at Voodoo Doughnut are doing. Along with weird.

I tried four doughnuts: The bacon maple bar (maple frosting and bacon), the dirt doughnut (vanilla frosting and Oreos), the sprinkle doughnut (vanilla frosting and sprinkles), and an Old Dirty Bastard (chocolate frosting, Oreos, and peanut butter), the last two which were vegan. I only took a bite of each, and every one, even the vegans, proved too rich for me. As comedian Robert Kelly would say, ""What the fuck does that mean, it's too awesome? You diabetic boring ass face.""

I may not be diabetic, but I guess I'm a boring ass face. I just couldn't eat them; they were too rich. I'd rather trek the mile over to BUNK and eat a pork belly cubano with a side of bacon and egg potato salad and a ""Mexican"" Coke instead. (Like I said, I'm all for decadence, it just depends on what kind.)

Something that pleasantly surprised me was how supple and moist the vegan dough was. I've had vegan doughnuts in the past and they were abominations. Like eating chalk. Why bother? It was nice to see people doing vegan right when there is so much wrong in the world.

Ultimately, Voodoo Doughnuts is not a great place, nor is it a bad place. Simply, it's proof that if you deep fry it and put Oreos, Cap'n Crunch, or actual strips of bacon on it, curious people will come.

(but I understand if you still do).

The line can get pretty crazy, but it moves relatively quickly. The doughnuts are funky and creative. You can get some fun stuff here. However, I do have a few complaints. First, it's difficult to go in there your first time because there's a big board on the wall with names of doughnuts, but no descriptions. So you aren't really sure what you're ordering . . . unless you try to point to a doughnut that's spinning around in their little case (in which there are no names to label the doughnuts). Good luck with that. Secondly, it is a lot of pressure to go up and say what you want since there's a long ass line behind you. If you are indecisive, this is not the place for you. Third of all, the doughnuts just aren't that good. Yes, they are creative. Yes, they look cool. Yes, I love the pink box. However, the underlying doughnut is meh. The husband got the Voodoo donut and it was waaaaaaay too sweet. I got the maple bar with bacon and it was too heavy on the maple. Go to Blue Star for some quality doughnuts instead.

Captain crunch/fruit loops donut was overly sweet. The cereal was getting kind of stale when I ate my donut.
Maple bacon bar was okay. I guess if you're into sweet+salty you'd like this.
The roadkill was probably my favorite one out of all of the ones I tried. Oreos, creme filling, and chocolate glaze. Can't go wrong.

Their dough is pretty soft, but it was something about the frosting/glaze. I felt like I was developing cavities with every bite. The glaze was extremely thick and it was hard to taste everything else because it was so overpowering.

Probably the most well known place in Portland due to TV coverage and a tourist's destination, they serve doughnuts in a very Portland way: keeping it weird. One great thing about Voodoo is that they sell Stumptown Coffee to go along with your sweet treats. You also get to cross off 2 foodie locations in one go! The most well known is the Voodoo doll doughnut which is shaped like (you guessed it!) a voodoo doll. It is filled with raspberry jelly to emulate the blood. The doughnuts itself are yeast based and each doughnut is well decorated. I tried the voodoo and the Portland cream and they were just alright. The doughnuts itself are good but the glaze on top is too sweet for my taste. I also thought the Portland cream doughnut could use more cream. It felt like i got one bite of cream and that was it. 

The decor of the place is extremely pink and really matches the name. There are some skulls, coffins, etc that really make this place what it is. Staff here are super friendly and really open to talk and see how you're doing. If you've never been, it's definitely worth checking out but just don't go in expecting the world's best doughnuts.

Let me start off by saying I've always wanted to grab and indulge myself into one of the famous VooDoo doughnuts. Even though I'm not a huge doughnut fan, I still wanted to partake of the experience.

It's outdated and yes I understand that it's he first of its kind, but with the income it brings, a facelift wouldn't hurt. I mean it's a business tale that you're supposed to upgrade every 10 years for good luck, but what do I know about luck? 

Anywho, the doughnuts. This is the kind of place where looks are deceiving. Not one did I enjoy, Not one.....and we purchased a dozen.

Once you get in the door though, you'll see a photo booth to the side and tons of donuts rotating in their cases as you get closer to the register. They seem to have a lot of apparel/items you can get as a gift as well. 

The dish: Captain crunch, Maple/Bacon, and Oreo.

The maple/bacon has legit bacon slices, and not bits on the top which was a nice change. The cereal based donuts had a great texture contrast but honestly it became too much and we couldn't finish the 4 donuts we got to split between 4 people since you can def taste the sugar rush after each bite. 

Advice: If you want to try this place just to try it, I suggest coming during their off hours because I don't believe waiting 30+ mins for this place is worth it.

I will soon be reviewing a few of those too. But as a vegan, I have not been able to bite into a yummy raised donut in YEARS. So I was very excited that they offer vegan options and I enjoyed every last bite. Thank goodness I can only eat these things when I visit Portland. I had the delicious Gay Bar - a cream filled long john with froot loops (I did pick those off). The only draw back was it left a weird film on the roof of my mouth.

As a first time visitor to Portland, I did not realize that the surrounding location would be sketchy.  I was with someone who walked with a cane so we decided to ride the MAX from Pioneer Place Mall (very short ride).  At the stop, we noticed that there were a few homeless people settling in for the night (we were there a bit after 7pm), as well as a few walking around and huddling in their oversized blankets.  If I had known beforehand about this neighborhood, I probably would not have attempted to come at night (none of this is the fault of the store).
The store itself had an old-school feel to it.  There was a big board that lists the names of the donuts they had, as well as a revolving window that showcases the donuts with their names.  I had studied the menu beforehand and knew which one I wanted to try (Chuckles), but I did wish that there was a bit more description next to some of the donuts.  I also realized that it was a cash only store.
We didn't get to have a chance to try the donuts until two days later.  However, I was a bit disappointed in the taste.  When comparing it to another donut place in Portland, it somehow didn't taste as good (those were eaten at a later date too).  The flavoring was a-ok, but not something I would want to come back again.
I have to admit that our Voodoo doughnut run was probably the most exciting adventure we had in Portland (while trying to get back to our hotel, we ran into someone asking for a doughnut-which we definitely weren't giving out; and it took us 30 minutes to walk back to downtown because we took the long way around trying to find the MAX station).

VERDICT: NOT APPROVED 

RUN-DOWN: I think that the hype for this donut place was too much. Yes, they make cool voodoo donuts but the actual taste of the donut was not that great. They do have some non typical donuts but their classic donuts were just eh to me. Most people come here for the hype and I can see why. But if you're looking for a delicious donut, I wouldn't recommend it. But you should check it out if you are into the trends.

SCORE & ORDER: 2.83/5 
* Guava Colada - $3.25 (3/5) 
 -This was an interesting flavor for a donut. This was a coconut topped donut with a guava jelly filling. This was an interesting donut because I have never had a guava filled donut and this was not bad. I am not a fan of guava and coconut but my dad said it was delicious. 
* Dirt - $2.25 (2.5/5) 
 -The first, for me was too sweet. Yes, donuts are supposed to be sweet, but this one was  little too much for me. The oreo was a great touch but when it came to the donut, it almost tasted like it was filled with sugar.
* Voodoo Doll - $3.50 (3/5) 
 -The classic donut that most people get for the picture. This donut was  chocolate donut with a jelly filling inside. It wasn't the best donut. Mine was a little deflated and the chocolate melted way too easily. It also tasted a little chalky for me. 

SERVICE & ATMOSPHERE
(not reflected upon review score): 
There is a long line (usually). When I went, there wasn't that long of a line. They have ll the donuts on display for you to see. The atmosphere is pretty different. There is a lot of pink and it's a pretty small shop that they lines usually reach out the door. Service was great. The get got out donut real quick and we were out which was fast.

And don't get me wrong, I'm not knocking the fact that the donuts are typically following a pretty traditional recipe (minus the eccentric toppings and appearances); I've been to a lot of small donut shops that do this as well and their donuts are amazing and delicious, but the donuts I ate at Voodoo didn't even taste particularly fresh; an impressive feat given the long line I waited in for these donuts.

there was a line out the door when we came on a thursday AFTERNOON...yes, afternoon. who woulda thought donut was considered an afternoon snack. the good thing about this location is that it's downtown near the food trucks and a coffee shop next door. so you can always get some grub at the food trucks then swing by to have a donut for dessert.

Now.. don't get me wrong. Voodoo was good. The doughnuts were very solid, fresh-tasting, and the chocolate frosting was fantastic.

You don't really go for the amazing culinary flavors. It's straightforward. They taste like average donuts but average donuts that have quirkiness. So more fun than the usual donut place. 

I recommend going for the experience at least once. 

To avoid waiting in a long line, I recommend going late at night. We came at around 10pm and that was perfect.  People, this place open 24 HOURS. You can go at any time. Save waiting in line for something worth it that can't be avoided. 

Tried the following raised yeast doughnuts that are recommendable:

Voodoo Doll (this would be the quintessential one to get) -- filled with raspberry jelly, topped with chocolate glaze, staked in its little heart with a pretzel stick; each one is slightly different; can you imagine the fun that the staff must have making each one?

Cock-N-Balls -- how can you not? Shaped as it sounds, filled with Bavarian cream and glazed with chocolate. 

McMinnville Cream -- topped with a maple glaze, filled with Bavarian cream; couldn't resist its cute beady eyes and curly mustache

I've seen insane lines that go down the block, I must admit that I've been guilty of waiting in those lines.

The decorations are fun and they take donuts to the next level by adding all these cereals and cookies to them. It's whats underneath all that make up that counts.. I mean frosting. You can dress it up as much as you want but at the end of the day the donuts are dry and virtually flavorless. Yeah, the donuts taste like instant diabetes but thats all from whatever is covering the donut. I've never wanted to dunk a donut in milk, but I absolutely feel that it is necessary. I know some people actually enjoy their donuts but for me, I can't get passed how dry it is and dense.

To describe the sensation of eating one of those cereal-topped abortions, one must look for metaphors that stray far from any notion of edibility. As my teeth sank into the stale, almost rubbery toppings, my mind raced backwards, much as a person's mind might whilst watching her/his life flashing before their eyes: I was younger, it was Christmas morning, and we had just gotten a brand new Nintendo Entertainment System...it was also my first time experiencing the ear-rending squeal of thick Styrofoam against cardboard as it slid from within its boxy restraints. 

Flash to present, and there is no video game system, encased in environmentally caustic Styrofoam, but a doughnut... 

...yes, eating this doughnut was like biting into sugar-covered packing materials. I only wish I were exaggerating. 

Humans are odd creatures...they congregate around the most unexplainable monoliths as if desperate to forge an identity - any identity - and in the inexplicable vortex of Portland's cultural stew, VooDoo Doughnut has somehow amassed a following.

I lived in Portland for several years and had the daunting task of taking visitors here because they just had to check it out. They all said the same thing..""they had really cool looking doughnuts, and funny names, but did not taste that good"". I say try the place out yourself, the doughnuts wont kill you or anything, just don't buy into the hype. It's OK to not like a place that all the ""cool"" kids like.

The first thing you notice when walking in is that this place is old and dungy. It doesn't look clean and the lighting is horrible. The customer service there is horrendous. They yelled at our group for standing in front of the door. If they don't want people standing in front of the door of a cramped 
 and overcrowded area they should set up line barriers to prevent this from happening. Yelling at customers doesn't really make the experience enjoyable. 

When we were called up to make our order we were met by a guy that was dressed very funky and was tattooed all over. I mean on his face, arms, and anything that was visible. I honestly was intrigued by all his tattooes. He had these knuckles tattoos with a line in between each knuckle followed by dots between the other knuckles on each finger. I had never seen that before so i asked what it meant. He looked at me and said ""you don't know!?"" to which i shook my head to indicate that i did not. He then said very rudely, ""if you don't know then you will never know!"" and walked away in disgust. He said it with such anger i was left there staring at the ugly pink walls of the shop in disbelief of what just happened. It was an eerie feeling being there to begin with and now it was a bad experience that kept turning worse. 

Now, i was hoping the doughnuts would redeem the bad experience. I tried the bacon maple doughnut. The doughnut tasted old and the bacon was dry and lacked flavor. To top it all off it wasn't reasonably priced either. 

Then what sealed the deal was that our group decided to eat our doughnuts a block away from the shop standing on the sidewalk. While eating them,  there was a man in his late 20s or early 30s standing about 5 feet away from us. We didn't think anything of it. He tried to make small talk with us but we kept to ourselves. A minute later we see him shooting up some heroin right in front of us. This was in the late afternoon and in public. 

Overall, I would give this entire experience 0 stars if it were possible. I will never step foot inside a VooDoo Doughnut shop again. Bad customer service, bad product, and it's located in area with junkies.",2017-10-23 20:15:41

So what's so special about Voodoo Doughnut. Like a lot of the places in this hipster-esque city, Voodoo Doughnut is a shop that experiments in a lot of unique types of doughnut combinations. For example, their Yelp business picture is a photo of the Maple Bacon doughnut. Literally, you have slices of bacon on a doughnut...

But still, sometimes popularity is justified right? We came in on a Friday morning at about 8am and there was already a long line going. Note, before you come, know that you will 1. have to wait a bit and 2. you need to pay in cash. 

You'll notice when you walk in that you are in a different world, transported into the Voodoo universe. There are interesting decorations on the wall, capped off by the unique combinations of doughnuts that they have. Don't be fooled though, they're just doughnuts...

I wanted to save my stomach and so I opted to try the Great Ape (it's like a normal glazed doughnut with purple sprinkles). Just my luck because they ran out... AT 8AM. So I ended up getting the captain doughnut.

What a mistake because it was literally a glazed doughnut with fruity captain crunch and frosting. It tasted like something I could make myself and I realized that I preferred and even craved Krispy Kreme Doughnuts after that. My friends also echoed my sentiments, saying that this place was a tad too overhyped.

I understand that Voodoo doughnuts is out there to experiment with different combinations, but I'd love it a lot more if the doughnuts actually tasted decent.

My measly review no. 362. 

I feel kinda bad about my 3 stars because of the cultural icon of Voodoo Doughnuts, but to me, the hype is much more than the genuine quality. I've been to two of their Portland locations. This particular one is in the heart of downtown and I've only been to twice. 

It's super busy and has a basic albeit awesomely creepy ambiance to it. I mean you can get married here in a coffin if you wanted-- They have creative doughnuts like the voodoo doll and a ""cock and balls"" (it's their menu...not mine). CASH ONLY! 

The doughnuts to me aren't special at all. With that being said, I haven't had many doughnuts to compare and I'm not a doughnut guy. I do buy the $10 bucket of day-old doughnuts sometimes. The leftovers go to charity for the most part, but you can get your hands on a bucket for super cheap and share them out. They come in a big frosting bucket and must have 20 doughnuts in it. Since I only live 6 hours away and my mom lives in the middle of that drive, there is a doughnut for all!  

All-in-all the cultural Portland vibe and the popularity is indeed worth the visit. If you're going downtown just for this, I suggest you visit their other location because it's not in the hustle and bustle of drunkenness, but rather somewhere with ample parking and seating.

I also got the plain glazed. As I normally do when trying places. It was yeast, dough y and fluffy. Not too sweet but I've had better even at nyc our home shop of Dough. 

Idk the doughnut didn't taste fresh. And while they do have nice seating outside, the area smelled like sewage which didn't really help their cause.

My very first trip to Portland we tried to come here but the line was around the corner. Waiting and waiting for a box of doughnuts just didn't seem worth it to me at the time, so we skipped it.

Round 2 the following year was a success only because we came around midnight and hardly no line. I remember browsing the doughnuts which seemed the majority were more about the shape and character. In fact, it seemed that many doughnuts available at the time didn't really excite me. 

I ended up ordering a doughnut with fruit loops which tasted exactly like it sounds. Wasn't bad, but didn't wow me either. I think the majority of these doughnuts are more about the design than taste.

Between the three of us, we had a box of doughnuts to go. By the morning, nobody wanted to eat any of them which resulted in the trash a few days later.

I see no difference in taste from Dunkin Donuts or some of the other donut shops in the Northeast. Locals who worked at my hotel literally rolled their eyes at me when I walked in carrying the big, pink box.

I have to give Voodoo credit for creating a brand and also getting creative with their donuts. A decade ago when they opened (before the 'foodie revolution' which brought pho, cronuts and street tacos to every suburban town in America) they were cutting edge. Nobody was putting Captain Crunch cereal or bacon on donuts. To do so was literally like the invention of smartphones ... unheard of by anyone, but loved by all.

Over the years they have stayed in the news by having the FDA stop them from making donuts with a shot of Nyquil or pepto bismo in the center, etc. Naming donuts The Old Dirty Bastard or Marshal Mathers has given them hipster street cred. But honestly, they didn't taste any different from donuts you could get at Wegmans or Dunkin. Maybe a bit more 'sugar bling' ...

My favorite of all was the maple bacon log. I also tried the original voodoo which beyond the cute doll shape was pretty much a standard Boston Cream donut shell with jelly inside. Nothing special beyond the likes it will get on instagram. The Memphis Mafia fritter was way too dense. After a few bites, I was over-sugared and full. Way too much going on here ... maybe it would have been better with a glass of milk.

They were out of the cake donuts when I went, around midnight, probably because they were the cheapest donuts at about a buck each. The other donuts were around $3 and the fritters like ODB, Memphis Mafia and Marshall Mathers, were $5 which was a complete rip off.

The line was about 10 minutes long. I was drunk and didn't mind waiting as the people watching was good. (its right next to two dance clubs) However, they don't really need the line ... it's just that they have 2 people working the counter (slowly) so I think the line pretty much just adds to the 'mystique' of the place. ""If people are willing to wait outside for 10 minutes, this must be legit!'

Glad I tried it. It didn't suck. But it wasn't really anything all that special. Maybe it would have been 5 stars in 2003 when it was impossible to find creative donuts anywhere. Oh yeah ... cash only. At least that hasn't changed since 2003.",2017-05-15 16:30:27

After you wait in line for (at least) a half hour, you are greeted with a spinning case of donuts.

They really aren't that great, lines are always long, and the donuts are expensive. There is someone out there placing spells on everyone that visits Portland that makes us visit VooDoo Doughnuts -- we just don't want to believe it.

They do offer quirky donut designs, and unique flavors, but they may be overdoing it a bit. It's like when I go to to FroYo Shop, and majority of my FroYo is toppings vs actual FroYo. And what is up with all this blow-me, cock-n-ball, penis shaped donuts? It's like I am in a porn shop for donuts.

The service is a little lacking as well. The people behind the counter seemed bored and uninterested. I don't know if that's how people are in Portland (not my first occurrence), but for such a touristy spot... they should at least try to care. Be happy, and sell us donuts with pride! lol

The donuts are not terrible, but I don't think they are necessarily worth the 30+ minute wait and price. We have our own specialty donut place in San Diego called Donut Bar, and although they do not have voodoo and penis designs (thank goodness!), they do have unique flavors and designs as well. I think our donut joint taste better, is safe for all ages and we don't believe in all that voodoo magic stuff. lol.

TIPS
-- They are open 24/7, so don't stop by during the rush hour
-- Cash only. There are nearby ATMs.
-- If you buy any cereal donuts, don't wait too long before you eat it because they will get stale.
-- I read on someone else's Yelp that they offer a bucket of ""Day Old Donuts"" for $10. I may look into that if I ever stop by Voodoo Doughnuts again. I just hope they are all family-friendly items. I can't imagine bringing home a bucket of donut shaped wieners. lol.",2016-09-13 00:22:34

But...I am a Portlander...born and raised. Alas I never discovered Voodoo when it was a little, small bakery. I found it after the behemoth it has become today. Maybe, as some have attested, it was a great shop back in the day. I can only judge it by the experience I had now.

I come from doughnut loving parents. I, for a time, lived next to a donut shop owned by a little old lady from Guam. It was a little hole in the wall, but her donut bakery made some amazing old school donuts. He would allow me to pop in just after he filled the case and grab a few. Oh those maple bars, old fashioned...the list goes on. Yummy. They were so good they even survived a Krispy Kreme opening literally across the street. 

One night my parents and I decided to venture downtown, late, and try Voodoo. The line wasn't too bad...and we ordered up a pink box filled with a dozen of the various kinds they had so we could sample all the creatively topped treats. The first thing that burned in my memory of my first experience there...the staff were less than friendly. Now perhaps this is part of the whole ""punk"" vibe the place goes for...but honestly...there is no place for unfriendly or poor customer service E V E R in a public facing business. This attitude extended to even the person's placement of our donuts in the box. Normally one carefully arranged and places the donuts so they don't get mashed or messed up. You'd think this would be even more so important for a place known for his toppings. Well our donuts were basically just tossed in the box....so much so they were a damn mess when we got them home. And no, I was careful with the box...they are donuts, its sacrilege not to be. ;-)

Once home we went into sampling what we got. Now, like most situations, when something is great it can overshadow waiting or poor service or many things. But when you venture through all that and the end result makes you go ""WTF?"" It really makes the whole thing sink. First, I have to say...before you go all nuts on your toppings, designs, etc....you have to have a solid foundation...in this case a solid donut. To me Voodoo fails at this necessary principle. The donuts themselves were old and stale. Like we were subjected to day or two old donuts. No amount of toppings were going to change that. Out of 12 offerings I cannot tell you a single one that was memorable. Not 1. And everyone involved in this adventure felt the exact same way. The toppings should be enhancing an already great donut. Yet in this case, it seems it's all novelty and no substance. In some ways it felt like the toppings were masking a lousy donut. 

Fortunately I discovered a true gem of the area long after my unpleasant experience at Voodoo. A true NW hole in the wall donut shop in Vancouver called Donut Nook. The place looks like you have time travelled when you walk in...but it's funky and inviting. The staff warm and friendly. And the donuts? Well that's the best part. While you won't get Captain Crunch mashed on them or one shaped like a penis with cough syrup drenched on top....you will get some fresh...amazingly flavor-filled donuts here. Ones we easily go back to and talk about all the time.

Skip the line...there are much better donuts to be had than Voodoo.",2018-10-21 17:40:27

We reached Voodoo's pretty early in the morning as a pre-game for an early hike.  It was a short wait, and we had the added benefit of seeing the city of Portland awake before our eyes (complete with a street resident emerging from a tipped newspaper dispenser).  When we stepped inside, we were impressed by the multi-colored decorations about the store and the trays upon trays of donuts behind the counter.  It is definitely a festive environment.

One thing that I can really vouch for Voodoo is the variety of donuts.  Each type of donut looks completely different from one another, so when you choose, there's a feeling that you could be missing out on a potentially tasty gold mine.  We ended up going for the voodoo dozen, (a cheaper alternative to selecting a dozen yourself), and set out on our day.  

Now here's the kicker: while it was fun to pick from the box throughout the day, I can't say there was a time when we would rave about Voodoo after eating a donut.  They taste like what they look like: donuts with some added pizzazz.  Their components taste great on their own.  Together? Enjoyable...but not life-changing.

I know this store makes bank, but they obviously aren't investing it back into the upkeep of the store.

After ringing me up with an air of distain, he went and THREW my doughnuts down in the box! Like, slammed them in!!! I kinda just looked at him like 'really'? And asked him if he had had a long night. He answered ""no more like long life"". And I took my doughnuts and left in satisfied with the service.

I will say: I liked the taste of the dough itself much better than I expected. The bubble gum one tasted like a peep on a donut, which was better than it looked. The old fashioned dipped in fudge was nauseatingly sweet and just NO. Don't do it. Homeless men hovered and told us our donuts looked good, and I wish I would have just given ours to them.

Many people have raved about their donuts but I think Voodoo's reputation exceeds expectations. Some donuts are better than others but most have a heavy oily taste and were exceedingly sweet. Maybe I don't like this type of donuts. 

I've heard about Voodoo donuts for years but didn't get a chance to visit last time I visited Portland. So when we were in town, our out-of-town friend suggested to try this place. Why not?

This location is open 24 hours. We waited in line for 30 minutes. The smell was heavenly (oil, fried bread) at 09:30. The line was filled with locals and tourists. My friend and I were super excited! So many flavors! They offer a coffin filled with donuts for $130. My friend joked about wanting to go out in a coffin full of donuts.

So we ordered: maple bacon donut, lemon chiffon crueller, captain my captain (captain crunch donut), hibiscus donut, the summer dream (marionberry filling with lemon frosting). 
The best donut was the the maple bacon donut. The bacon was savory smoked and crispy. Unfortunately, the frosting didn't gel with the bacon. 

The summer dream wasn't bad and I liked the sound of the marionberry filling. The filling was ok but the frosting but a little too sweet for me, it tasted like a fondant. The best texture was the lemon chiffon crueller. It was a crispy and cakey but the marshmallows were unnecessary. 

The service was curt and quick. Like NYC. So all in all, Voodoo Doughnut was fun to look, take pictures but the donuts were a little disappointing.",2017-08-31 01:36:16

I most recently tried some longer bar-looking glazed donut, which I found to be too dense and too sweet, as well as a Fruit Loops donut and a Captain Crunch donut, both of which were too sweet and way too sugar.  The sweet frosting was quite unnecessary considering we all are aware that kid cereals are packed with too much sugar as it is- and these are cereals I grew up eating and loving!  On donuts, however, they're not as good.

The donuts seem to have dropped in quality a bunch since the olden days when I would walk blocks across town for a pink box filled with doughy goodness. It's been a few years since I've had a VooDoo donut, and things seem to have changed. 

For the most part, the donuts here are a step above your average grocery store donut. What really still drives VooDoo is the gimmickry and awesomeness of their designs. The Tex-ass is still impressive, the cock n balls is hard to beat, and anything with crushed up oreos on it rules. As much as people like to hate on the disaffected staff, I still find it kind of endearing. It all combines to create a simply ridiculous atmosphere in which to purchase ridiculous donut creations. 

Now I should say, I still prefer cakey donuts to airy, fluffy ones, so IMHO, places like Krispy Kreme don't hold a candle to Voodoo. But having tried other place like Annie's and Joes, both of which produce par-for-the-course grocery store quality donuts, I still stand by my assessment that Voodoo makes some of the best donuts Portland has to offer.

30 - The number of total strangers who had no shame in shouting out to me, ""Hey, buddy! Can I have one of your doughnuts?""

Seriously. That is no exaggeration. More than 1 completely unknown stranger (mind you, these were NOT the homeless people who harass patrons lining up outside an establishment well known as ""Cash Only"") would ask me every few yards whether I could spare a donut from the box (less than half a dozen) I was carrying.

Voodoo Doughnuts (VD) is a Portland institution, with their Portland Cream (essentially Boston Cream with two eyeballs) actually being recognized in 2008 by the Mayor of Portland as the official doughnut of the city... Open 24 hours, VD adds kitsch, convenience, and reliability that stands it apart from the plethora of ""Stoner food"" destinations in Portland.

I'm reluctant to call VD a PR gimmick or a tourist trap for every now and then you'll be surprised by the merits of a doughnut. Then again, I don't know which 24 hour establishments across this great country would truly rank as great, at least when sober. I think it would be fair to sum them up based on the website's version of the VD story: ""stunningly brilliant business sense"" for ""two people who had never made a doughnut before"".  One manifestation of their genius was to come up with the (now outlawed by the Health Dept.) Vanilla Pepto Crushed Tums Doughnut for ""that shot of tequila at 2 am...you got sugar, bread, Pepto, and Tums, you'd either feel better or puke your ass off and then feel better because you got it out of your system "".

after waiting for 45 minutes and getting our two boxes of donuts, I thought to myself, REALLY???  This is what has gotten the tourists nuts about this place?

Their service STUNK.  Yeah, they were fast (too fast) but there was an arrogance to their attitude. Like, ""Oh yeah, we're hot stuff and we know it.  Look at our Yelp reviews and all the different shows that feature us.""

NEXT!!!!!

So not impressed.

Then there was the actual sugary snacks - which wasn't any better than the good stuff I've had across this country.  Seriously?  This is the best Portland has to offer.

Do yourself a favor - there are PLENTY of good eats in Portland where the servers have senses of humor and serve you with courtesy instead of attitudes of entitlement - TRY ***THOSE*** PLACES OUT.

I will not come back. I will not recommend this place to ANYONE, even if I don't like you. I don't even know why I'm bothering with this review because I'm not sure anyone will read it.  But there it is. =)",2019-02-20 02:47:44

After visiting Philly and trying the amazing Federal Donuts, I was really excited to see what Portland had to offer in terms of donuts. I had heard good things about donuts in Portland, but we made the mistake of trying Voodoo Doughnut instead of other places (next time I want to try Blue Star Donuts).

We arrived on a Sunday morning and waited in a 20-minute line before ordering. The shop was very pink, cool, and unique. However, after we ordered around 6 different flavors and ate our donuts, we were all disappointed. I tried the Bacon Maple Bar (yeast donut) and the Marshall Mathers (cake donut), which were both too sweet and didn't taste that much different than a typical donut.

I know it seems like a fun touristy thing to do, but I wouldn't recommend visiting Voodoo Doughnut. There's usually a long line outside that moves slowly, you have to pay 10 cents for a water cup (which feels greedy and also ruins the point of cash-only in no-sales-tax-Oregon because you're going to get change!), and the donuts, while unique and arguably creative, just aren't good.",2018-10-04 23:02:53

There are times when you can visit without standing in a line for an hour+, but most people decide to go mid-afternoon on a weekend day when it's nice out so expect to wind your way through Disneyland-style person barricades with about 200 other clueless people as you dodge panhandlers and e-scooters. 

Look, its an experience that you'll only get in downtown Portland, and I can't blame people for going down there (I did, once) but it's overrated at best. The staff, when you get to the part where you can order, are overworked and carry the kind of 'tude that stems from direct hatred of humankind. They've got to deal with agitated customers and a whole host of other problems (aforementioned panhandlers) so you can't really blame them. You can just avoid the situation entirely.

These poor souls have not been blessed by the other certain -colored celestial object- donut shop that is present in Portland. Sure, you get some fancy flavors here but for the price and wait time- take a pass!

That being said, I guess if you're in Portland for the first time, I'd give it a try. THEN go to Blue Star and see what a real quality donut is like. I'll give them perks for being open 24/7 though! Voodoo has a very fun and pink aesthetic that makes them so special. Are you really a tourist if you don't get a pink box to take a pic of? There's outdoor seating for you to set up the perfect scene right outside their shop.

Anyways about the donuts- what you actually came here for right? They are alright lol. I did enjoy the maple bacon and the Old Dirty Bastard (peanut butter and oreos), but was whatever about the hibiscus and Homer Simpson donut. Their glaze didn't give me this high quality feel for the high quality price I was supposedly paying for. I'm glad I only waited in line for like 15-20 minutes, and this was on a Monday afternoon. I can't even imagine how long a weekend line takes and I've seen it- poor people waiting in the sun. However once you're in there, it seemed to move pretty fast. They are efficient with taking orders and they have donuts on a rotating display so you can choose donuts based on how they look (which is really what you're here for).

It was actually a quick process if you already know what you want. Once you order it's like bam you get it right away. The cashier was very patient even though it was so busy. So that's a plus. As others have mentioned this place is cash only.

""Just say no to Voodoo Doughnuts."" Noelle W.

On our long road trip Voodoo Doughnuts was definitely on our list of places to try. We parked around the corner which was a short 5 minute walk to the doughnut shop. Passing the dive bars and restaurants my senses were offended by the smoke from the local patrons.

We stood in a rather long line. Most of this line was comprised of locals and a few tourists. The people in front were definitely hippie like and had the worst body odor ever. I was not going to be deterred. I was on a mission. That mission- to get a dozen of these Voodoo Doughnuts. We finally were ready to order. I picked three Portland Creams, three cinnamon sugar, two Voodoo Dolls, two Bacon Maple Bars and two Neapolitan. The only doughnut that tasted decent was the Portland Creams- delicious chocolate frosting and amazing Bavarian Cream. I saw the customer service person take our doughnuts from the racks and they seemed fresh. The doughnuts were extremely dry almost to the point of stale. 

CONS
~The flies flying above in the foyer.
~The dirty and smelly foyer.
~The fact the customer service person told me while picking my doughnuts, ""You don't have to order one dozen."" Whereby I replied, ""I want to order one dozen of your doughnuts.""
~When I inquired about purchasing a t-shirt the disgruntled employee rolled their eyes, quickly walked away and quickly came back to say, ""No we don't have any more.""
~The dry and staleness of the doughnuts.
~Cash Only.

PROS
~If you've never been here and are lucky to read my review- save your money and taste buds, just skip it.

It is quintessential Portland and I would never discourage a tourist from going there for the first time - but, I would suggest that once you've had voodoo, there is no reason to go back. 

First, the sheer popularity of it is enough to discourse me to Blue Star or Coco's or.. dare I say? The Fred Meyer bakery. It sits in the worst neighborhood, both for parking and heckling, and the line to get in zigzags between metal gates as if a Disneyland scale roller coaster awaits you at the end. Nope, alas, just mediocre donuts. 

They are fun shapes, unique flavors, etc. so they are perfect for getting a selfie with a novelty donut in a pink box so everyone knows you went to Portland and didn't explore anything cool.

Pros:
- The cool slow-spinning tray of doughnuts available near the cashier. You can definitely see which ones you'd WANT to add into the pre-selected box they provide you. These boxes normally contain the popular selections but if you want to add extras, you can, but you have to pay extra.
- Aside from the doughnuts, they also sell some cool merch like shirts and mugs.
- Despite the line, the service is pretty fast.
- Open 24 hrs for those who get hungers at 3am.
- Their doughnuts have some unique names and concepts, like the maple blazer blunt, mango tango, and dirt... literally.

Cons:
- The hype was real but the taste wasn't the deal. Pretty much your standard doughnuts, but not as great as mom-and-pop doughnut stores.
- Parking is available on the street or garages if they're actually available.

Not as in they were so terrible that they were a joke, but as in ""Well...I guess that's another buzz food to check off the list. Ha ha."" 

Voodoo makes very solidly average doughnuts in terms of taste, but its personality and sense of humor are awesome. The doughnuts themselves aren't very special - too heavy and sticky and cloying for my tastes; I'll take Shipley's any day - and it's definitely the eye-catching novelty of their decorations that do the legwork. I mean, where else do you find doughnuts topped off with Fruit Loops and chocolate-drizzled Oreo chunks? Once you get past the initial giddiness most of them are actually kind of disappointing though. The Voodoo Doll, for instance, while cutely decorated, is really just a normal raspberry jam doughnut underneath. The Diablos Rex, under the guise of such a badass name, is just a chocolate doughnut with red and white icing/sprinkles piped around in a gimmicky pattern. The pretty purple doughnut, upon further inspection, is a plain doughnut with purple glaze and purple sprinkles. The supposed lavender and grape flavors weren't very strong. The one doughnut I did really like was the bacon maple. Because BACON MAPLE.

Maybe I just had the wrong expectations coming in or was unlucky enough to choose all 'boring' doughnuts, but I thought the doughnuts would just be more interesting. Like what if the Diablos Rex were made of Mexican dark chocolate, or the purple doughnut were actually lavender flavored? Now that would be cool.

tl;dr: YOUR MOMMA WAS RIGHT, LOOKS ARE DECEIVING. Average tasting doughnuts that don't have much substance under all the flashy deco. You still walk away vaguely happy with their sense of humor though.",2015-06-30 00:23:15

I drove down with my family from Seattle and going to Voodoo was on the top of our bucket list. After waiting for about 30 minutes in line and excitedly discussing which flavored doughnuts we were all getting, I was about to experience one of the biggest foodie let downs. The doughnuts were not warm and the taste was average. 

The doughnut flavors are pretty creative-- we got the guava, chuckles, ODB, and dirt doughnuts. I thought the guava doughnut was the best. Very fresh and great center guava ganache filling. However the other three were nothing special. The dirt doughnut was too sweet, with icing and oreo, and the ODB was basically the dirt with peanut butter drizzle. I would prefer Krispie Kreme or Top Pot doughnuts over these.

I liked the vibe of Voodoo, it seemed very trendy and Portland-y. I also think maybe Voodoo has created its own hype? The employees worked incredibly slowly at the cash register, hence the long lines. 

Also random side note-- they didn't have knives to cut the doughnuts. How were we supposed to share??

The donuts may seem unique, but they taste disgusting. 
The loop donut is just a really bad mix of flavors, I don't even think a child would like it. The Marshall Mather donut would have been okay but the frosting tastes gross. The Neapolitan donut also had a strange blend of flavors, but it was the old one with soft dough. Again, the homer donut also had bad frosting and the dough tasted kind of stale.

Soo if you must, I recommend the Bacon Maple Bar doughnut!! The perfect combination of maple frosting and bacon yummm... This was the real winner out of all the donuts we tried. And we took two trips to this location in our weekend getaway so we tried quite a few donuts!! The bacon on top had the perfect balance between crunch, salt, and sweetness. What isn't delicious with bacon on top?!?!

Other than that, everything else was pretty average. Good donuts but nothing else that I felt was really worth the calories LOL. If you really need to try a selection of donuts besides just the bacon maple bar, try to stick to donuts with filling. It tastes so much better with a bite of custard or jelly rather than just donut alone.

Stay away from donuts with cereal on top! They look so cute but it turns out way too sweet and the cereal gets soggy if you don't eat the whole donut right away!!

Most of the donuts taste like regular donuts but they're not bad at all. I like that there are so many unique flavors and names.

Quality: I was happy with both doughnuts I tried. I don't know if they deserve the iconic status they have reached, but both doughnuts I tried were good. I thought the Bacon Maple Bar was the better of the two, but there is something cool about the Voodoo Doll. I have a feeling though that the real highlights are the less attractive looking options
Quantity: Large doughnuts that can easily be shared.
Value: $3.00 for the Voodoo Doll. $3.50 for the Bacon Maple Bar.
Ambiance: Voodoo Doughnut has a few locations, but I visited the one just north of Downtown Portland. It sits on the corner of a small strip of bars and restaurants. Outside they have pink barriers setup for long lines, but luckily it wasn't needed on this day. Outside they also have some tables and umbrellas, but with a downpour, it is was not a feasible option. Inside the shop is small, with just enough space for the line to wriggle one last time before the register. You will find memorabilia, gear, and of course, rotating doughnuts.
Crowd: On a miserable rainy day, the line was not what I was told to expect. It took less than 10 minutes to make it to the front and grab my treats. I assume that is a rarity on the weekend.
Service: The line moves fast. I assume they were prepared for a bigger crowd.

She needs to understand that most people are coming in are tourists and they aren't going to know exactly what they want.

So after dealing with her bitchy ass, she doesn't hand me our receipt but throws it in the box and now I have a receipt with chocolate all over it. 

Well after all that she didn't even offer a bag or anything so I just left.  Glad I went and now can knock going to voodoo donuts off my checklist of things to do in Portland.

Ok, maybe that's not so funny (especially if you the one holding the pink box) but we've all seen it right? Those poor souls who were somehow convinced by friends or family that the donuts at Voodoo were so transcendent that they just HAD to bring one of those cumbersome boxes home as one of their carry-ons. 

I get it - the first time you go there, there is some general amusement over their playfully-named     (crass?) risque confections. But that amusement wears off in far less time than it took standing in line. Because once you bite into the donut, you realize: ""Huh, that's it?"" Yes, they get points for creativity on presentation, but they fall short in where it really matters: how their donuts actually taste. At best, they are just ok, and at worst they taste stale and old - as if someone spent took a lot of time decorating the donuts and they don't want them to go to waste. 

If you are in Portland for the first time and want to check the box on a ""quintessential Portland experience,"" (Don't forget to post your pics on Facebook!!) then go ahead and wait in line at Voodoo. If you actually want to eat an amazing donut, then skip this tourist joint and head over to Blue Star.

(No, I don't work at Blue Star. I just really like donuts. I have a belly to prove it.)

We got some others- the hibiscus, graham slam, bacon maple bar, old dirty bastard... all in all, they just tasted like regular donuts but SUPER sweet.

We had to pass a couple of strip bars and Pizza Slut before we saw the bright pink neon sign which had attracted long lines even in the cold rain.

Once inside, the shop is pretty small with memorabilia decorating the walls. The donuts slowly turn in their glass cases while everyone ogled their colorful shapes and names.

The wait staff were busy as heck since the shop is 24/7, but they still were friendly and nice. That made the experience since it's overwhelming to be faced with so many donut choices.

To make it easier, there is a laminated menu at checkout so you can pick while the staff run to get the donuts.

I ordered 5 donuts for about $14. The donuts were placed in the iconic pink box which I saw a lot of people bring back on my returning flight. 

Is it better than any other donut? It was good but I think flavor profiles were fairly common with other donut shops, though the clever names were what made them distinctive.

I hate feeling like a tourist when I visit new cities. Everyone knows about Voodoo Doughnuts, and the only reason we actually stopped in was because: 
A. We ended up right down the street,   
B. The line was unusually short, and 
C. To say that we did it, and tried it. 

I wouldn't say I'm a donut person. I have about 1.25 every year or so. So I thought this would be the perfect time to get that ""1"" part of the donut in, to almost reach my quota for the year. 

Here are my thoughts about voodoo:

-The line is apparently very long, and it's only once you reach the front door that you see the sign that they take ""Cash Only"". Maybe this is a well known thing, but it was unknown to my friend and me, so thankfully he had some cash to pay. I feel like this is something that could be advertised, or said earlier.... while you're waiting in line. 

-I feel like it would be beneficial if there were a menu along the side of the building where everyone has to stand at one point.  There is not nearly enough time to get in through the door, and look at the menu to decide what you want before you're at the register.    Make the infamous long line exciting! Like a Disneyland ride! Give me stuff to read and look at, and pictures/sayings/insights to enhance my cravings for donuts!   Otherwise, once you make it to the inside of the building, it's extremely overwhelming trying to look at the very clustered menu, or the endlessly spinning racks of donuts... I suggest not even trying to understand the menu. Get an idea of a donut you want from the spinning racks. 

-The donuts are a lot cheaper than you imagine!! I was seriously thinking one would be close to $5 or so, but the majority are in the 1-2 $ range, with even some .95 ones. That's awesome! But don't get too crazy with buying a dozen donuts until you read my next point...

-These donuts are [underlined, bolded and italicized:] EXTREMELY SWEET. We decided to get 2 of them to try different options [We got the Chuckles, and the Dirty Ol' Bastard], and we pulled them into halves. I couldn't even finish mine. I was so sugar shocked it wasn't funny. I felt the sugar all day in my back and my kidneys, and vowed never to consume sugars again [ha, like that lasted.] I suggest getting 1 donut and splitting it with a loved one. Or even someone you don't like. Feel good knowing that they will be just as uncomfortable and zapped with sugar as you are. 

-Voodoo is apparently open 24 hours a day... but it sounds like it's NOT a place you want to be around when it gets dark. When we asked the cashier if they had a plastic knife to cut our donuts in half, she replied saying that they do have have anything that can be made into a weapon, because it's a sketchy/dangerous part of town at night. So keep that in mind, wary travelers! Do not make late night donut runs, Portland stoners!

Overall, at the end of the day, a donut is a doughnut. [Doughnut is a donut]. They had some creative and fun looking ones, but I do not think this will ever be a place I visit again. It was yummy, but it left me feeling so icky inside. I WAS sugar.  I mean, do it to do it. Because really... who can say no to a nicely priced donut?

TL;DR:
Voodoo Doughnuts is known for their creative donuts and infamously long lines. Make sure you have cash in yo' wallet if you're hoping to get anything once you make it through the threshold. Decide what you want by looking at the spinning racks - don't waste your precious time with the very clustered, but fun-donut name menu.  The donuts will course so much sugar in your veins you'll wonder if you'll ever feel human again. Split one with someone, unless you really believe you can handle it, or if you get off on sugar shock. You do you, but you've been warned. Visit during daylight hours. No plastic knives. The pigeons don't like the donut icing. This place is probs better suited for NOLA.",2015-11-05 21:31:24

But there was some cool donuts in there like cookies and cream, and ones with fruit loops, and M&Ms. The second time we went back was because we wanted to try the maple bacon bar. I have to say this was really disappointing. It was a bar shaped doughnut with a maple glaze and one strip of bacon just slapped on top. Since having this doughnut, I have had at least 4 different maple bacon donuts and all of those donuts blew this one out of the water. Badly. They really should have at least chopped the bacon into pieces to spread out the saltiness. So that each bite you'd be getting the contrast of the sweet glaze and the salty bacon.

Bacon Maple Bar - My fave of the bunch! Was a bit skeptical bc the 2 strips of bacon were just slapped on there...but my oh my - the tasty bacon + the maple glaze = complete and utter foodgasm! THE perfect blend of sweet & salty. While the maple bacon doughnut over at Blue Star was far more appealing to the eye, the Bacon Maple Bar from Voodoo was by far much tastier. 

Old Dirty Bastard - had to get it out of respect for it's namesake! A few bites were quite tasty..but after awhile too sweet for this fan.

Captain my Captain - aka the Captain Crunch doughnut. Thought this would be way to sweet..but mmm delicious. Loved the crunch from the cereal. Perfect with a nice cup of coffee!

Triple Chocolate Penetration - aka the Cocoa Puffs doughnut. Ehhh..maybe we had a bad batch..but the cocoa puffs tasted a bit stale on ours. Pass.

Portland Cream - yum! Is it blasphemy to say this is just like a Boston Cream doughnut? Hehe whatever you want to call it, loved the bavarian cream filling!

-Donuts taste pretty bad.  They also don't survive the ""test of time"" and taste disgusting the next day.
-Menu is confusing and not detailed at all.  They list the donut name (which is usually something cool/witty) but they don't tell you what it is / what's inside it.  
-Expect long wait times.
-Lots of homeless around the area.

I may be bringing down some bad juju on me for saying this, but Voodoo Doughnuts is an overhyped tourist trap. Yes, the donuts look creative and cute, but taste-wise, there is nothing special here that your local Southeast-Asian-owned doughnut shop most likely named Happy Donut cannot duplicate.

The original location is in what was the old Chinatown, steps from the waterfront and the Willamette River. After stopping by the Portland Saturday Market a block over, we noticed tourist after tourist carrying around those Pepto Bismol pink boxes. So, the wife and I finally caved and reluctantly decided to try Voodoo. 

Surprisingly, the line moves pretty quickly and the inside of the store is decorated with a ton of cool stuff. Also, the workers were really nice. Sadly, that is where the positive experiences ended. 

We got the Voodoo Doll, The Homer, and the Bacon Maple Bar. The Voodoo Doll is definitely Insta-worthy. However, the raspberry jelly was way too sweet and is probably what is going to kill you more than the pretzel stake. The Homer, named after Homer Simpson, is a doughnut with strawberry frosting and sprinkles that was alright. And, the Bacon Maple Bar was good, but it's something that I've had at other doughnut shops. 

After sharing three diabetes-inducing donuts, the wife and I immediately had to eat the yuzu ramen next door even though we weren't even hungry. You see, we needed to balance all that sugar with some soup. 

At the end of the day, Voodoo appears to be magical for some since they have expanded across America from Hollywood to Austin, Denver to Orlando. But for me, I prefer doughnuts that are not so sugary.",2019-08-27 21:58:04

Your tastebuds will not thank you necessarily for the remnants for sale at the shop, waiting to be packed into a bright pink box with Baron Samedi striding about in all his inky glory. I should've sacrificed a Timbit to him first, shouldn't I? 

I joined a queue headed out the door on a rainy Portland night, which I'm no stranger to being from ""big"" Vancouver, Canada. February so often brings these drizzly nights where streetlights smear into a mash of neon orange on anthracite facades. I dutifully fed the ATM and received cash to cover a box of doughnuts, rather than pick just two or three. Excess is the rule here, not the exception. Considering I was flying out in seven hours, I suppose the doughnuts were intended to tide me over to the airport and through my flight back to Chicago. My perceptions were clouded by the multiple recommendations to get a maple bacon doughnut, because of its sinful excellence and the fact I am, as forementioned, Canadian. I don't care for bacon much but there is a degree of cultural expectation I have to live up to.

The shuffling line of zombies seeking sugary sustenance proceeded forward under laughing eyes of dim spectres. The shop plays up its vodoun origins to the hilt, and peeling photographs and magazine articles add just a lurid touch. You are entering an institution and you will not put a bird on it, you will wring a bird for it, if you must. I was eagerly anticipating a host of changing flavours, often predicated upon how bizarre the combination might be -- let's put tang with fruit loops on a chocolate doughnut; a kruller with hot sauce, chipotle, ground up Oreos, and simple syrup anyone? By the time I got through the queue, I was half-dead myself and ready to eat the suppurating tattooed arm of a hipster, if it came to it.

I did get my maple bacon. The list of twenty some-odd flavours I wanted to try were gone. Each successive person ambling to the counter depleted the remnants and left me with the day's less desirable choices. Gone was ODB. Gone was a Dubble Bubble. One Memphis Mafia remained, one Captain my Captain, and NO Voodoo Dolls. I could've slapped down the two people in front of me who grabbed the last cock and balls, and proceeded to order thirty doughnuts from the stock. You could hear the sighs and growls in a chorus, damning their rudeness. People, it's late, they're not making any more, and the rest of us are waiting in the cold, cloying showers for our chance at a doughnut opportunity. Stop being a complete, self-interested douche. If you live here, you can come back tomorrow. Some of us can't. May Legba curse you with baggy jeans and cardigans! 

The dozen doughnuts I had were as much candy as they were pastry products. Friends and I departing on the outbound flight in the morning decided to pick and choose with some assistance from the menu guide and the employee, and we ended up snarfing pieces from each at our liberty like kids set loose in Willy Wonka's labs. Fruit loops on blue tang frosting, orange shot Rice Krispie treat jumble? First rotted my teeth, the second redeemed my tongue. There wasn't one except for the maple bacon bar, which I scored one of the second to last of, that I consumed in full because post-wedding reception isn't the best time to be Voodooing it up. For large part, they're incredibly sweet or very cakey, and best to appeal to people with a sweet tooth. I am not the sort who purrs at the sound of chocolate. 

Mistaken information from Portland International Airport suggested that we wouldn't be able to take our doughnuts with us on the plane, so I and my friend scarfed as many as we could and cursed fate. We abandoned our doughnuts in the trash, only to see at least four boxes on the flight back to Chicago. Needless to say, I was not impressed by that.

Voodoo's drawbacks are obvious. Long lines and limited stock reap havoc for when you show up at peak hours, as I apparently did. Spending thirty minutes or more in a slow-moving line while taunted by the chalkboard menu knowing you aren't going to get to see at least half of them doesn't earn a five star rating from me. Combinations of flavours get downright nauseating for how sweet some of them are; avoid the ones with breakfast cereals and powdered juice mixes where possible. I also wish some of their sizes were smaller because this is too much doughnut for a sitting, though I suspect the price makes them meant to be shared.",2013-01-06 15:38:29

From its location next to a seedy theatre to its in-your-face customers and employees, this isn't your cookie-cutter hipster joint outta Williamsburg or Silverlake or The Mission. This is the real deal.  Personified as a hipster, VooDoo Doughnut is a Pacific Northwest original, coming right at you with face tattoos, loud music, and maybe a little heroin problem.  It's brash, it's in your face, and all the while a bit cheeky and playful.

Take, for example, the Tex-Ass.  A ""Texas-sized"" doughnut reminiscent of...  a hemorrhoid donut.  Or the famous Cock n' Balls, shaped like -- well, DUH. Then you have the infamous VooDoo doll donut being pierced by pretzel sticks and bleeding jelly filling, followed by some Froot Loop covered monstrosity. And, of course, the piece de resistance, the doughnut that put Portland on the cable TV travel show radar:  The bacon maple bar.

This modern-day legend has earned its hipper-than-thou status on its don't-give-a-fuck creativity and attitude, the same attitude I'll express when I tell you this:

THESE. DOUGHNUTS. SUCK.

You can get as creative as you want. You can crumble up Oreos and drizzle on caramel and call it an Ol' Dirty Bastard. You can get yourself featured on TV shows on both the Food Network and the Travel Channel.

Full disclosure: I don't have a huge sweet tooth, so this might be a preference thing. That being said, both donuts we ordered (Bacon Maple Bar + Oh Captain My Captain) were sickly sweet to the point where we didn't finish either one.

The Bacon Maple Bar was the better of the two. Despite being cold, the bacon was still relatively crispy. Its smokey and salty flavors also balanced out the otherwise overpowering maple frosting. Would have liked a better bacon-to-donut ratio, since the current layout covers ~2/3rds of the pastry.

When I tell my friends that I'll visit Portland, they would always ask me to grab some pastries at Voodoo Doughnut. The business was founded in 2003 by Kenneth ""Cat Daddy"" Pogson and Richard ""Tres"" Shannon, both Portland natives. The idea of starting their own doughnut shop came up when the two friends were tubing down the Sandy River one fateful day. At the time, there were only five doughnut shops in Portland. They weren't familiar with the doughnut industry, and so they had to travel to California to learn from doughnut masters who had about 100 years of doughnut-making experience. Fast forward to today, Voodoo Doughnut has become synonymous with Portland. The business knows how to keep Portland weird through its creative doughnut flavors. Voodoo also has locations in Eugene, Denver, Austin, and LA.

I don't have a strong opinion on whether or not it is worth the hype. The donuts aren't too shabby. In fact, I think their yeast donuts are fluffier and tastier than the average American doughnut. Definitely fresh. However, they are on the expensive side. I ordered the voodoo doll (raised yeast doughnut filled with raspberry jelly and topped with chocolate frosting and a pretzel stake). Lots of flavors to choose from (over 50)! For example, bacon maple bar, old dirty bastard, voodoo bubble, mango tango, etc.

A few other notes... Yes, you can pay using debit/credit cards. Nope, no gluten-free doughnuts. And yes, they have vegan options.

The doughnuts are nothing special. Think doughnuts from anywhere and drop them in the self serve cereal bins at WinCo. Mmmmm - sugary stale cereal coated fried globs of white flour.

I'd give this place 2.5 stars if I could, but since I can't I'm demoting it to 2 since the hype raises your expectations. Also: the area can be kinda sketchy at night. 

You often see people carrying their pink voodoo boxes in the airport or while roaming around local hotspots. It's one of those touristy things that makes you wanna join in on the fun! 

But you show up, feel excited by the pink lit up sign, smirk at the clever-sounding names for the donuts and wait in line (hopefully no longer than 15 min) only to be met with the dry texture of a decorative donut with the flavor complexity of standard cake fondant and the equally bland personality of a cashier that has maybe worked too many busy shifts. 

I've ordered the following: 
- mango tango (probably my favorite of the bunch. Wasn't stale, tasted like mango)
- oh captain my captain (stale. Very, very stale)
- viscous hibiscus (very excited for this, but I couldn't much tell the flavor)
- others ordered by family members that I can't quite remember (didn't make a lasting impression)

I'm left with the impression that the titles are trying  too hard to be trendy, and now I know that the cute bits of cereal, icing, and other decorate edible items on the donut are the equivalent of spraying scented febreze after someone took a dump in the bathroom - your senses are initially fooled, but very quickly you encounter the crap just beneath the surface.",2019-06-14 22:05:05

Like I said, worth a trip just for the experience but I am sure the locals would attest to much better donut joints around town. These were just ""okay"" and I felt like I needed insulin afterwards.

I had a hard time just finding a regular donut (don't much care for fruit loops or bacon on my donuts) so I gave up and asked my husband to just pick something for me (in other words, I gave up - that is never a good sign).  It was stressful enough finding a parking spot, getting across the street, having it be 11pm-12pm downtown next to some strip club, homeless all over the place, being hit up for money in line when outside the building, then being inside in the amusement park line -- only to be met by staff with attitude.

CASH ONLY.  Parking is hard, then you need to cross the street, felt like I had to memorize what I wanted so I did not make others have to wait in line longer.  There is no seating so you have to leave right after and get back to the car, or stand outside with who knows who.

They are still pretty good doughnuts with wild and inventive creations that make you feel as if you've walked into a new franchise brought to you by Willy Wonka and his chocolate factory. 

As far as first impressions go, walking into Voodoo is a trip and you almost do feel like someone put a spell over you. The displays of various brightly colored and creatively concocted doughnuts are so fun to look at and for taking photos. You definitely feel like a kid again which is always a good thing.

But I must've inherited donut snobbery having grown up on a steady diet of donuts. Also, since becoming a Yelper I've been on a never-ending journey for good donuts. 

PROS:
- Maple Bacon Donut - possibly one of the best bacon donuts I've had. Proper execution of sweet meets savory and neither overpowers the other. Plus full strips of bacon!
- Voodoo Doll and Cock N' Balls donuts are something else to behold. I wasn't so much impressed with how they tasted (very, very sweet) but the level of intricacy that they go into the appearance/theme is very cool.

CONS:
- Ordering the Cock N' Balls. Just a different experience asking the male cashier, ""hey, can I have the Cock N' Balls please?""  
- Getting a box of donuts is sugar overload. I would recommend trying one first that you are really interested in so that you get the experience of having visited Voodoo and can check it off your list.
- The donuts are room temperature which makes sense considering if they were hot, there would be no way to maintain those cool designs. But, I like my donuts warm or hot and that does affect how it tastes.

Overall, I recommend trying Voodoo because as a tourist it is totally worth checking out to see donuts you probably won't find elsewhere. Its a spectacle for sure in both appearance and taste but it wasn't quite as tasty as I would've hoped. 

Tips: take your donuts around the corner to Stumptown Coffee Roasters where you can sit, order a latte, and enjoy your donuts indoors away from the cold.",2014-01-30 21:11:47

The donut itself is nothing different than other places. I also got a RASPBERRY FILLED DONUT that is decorated with tons of frosting to mimic a Voodoo doll because there is a pretzel stick through it. The APPLE FRITTER was HUGE. It was also very sweet with all the glazed sugar. OREO DONUT wasn't anything special other than crumbs of Oreos on top of the donut. ALL the donuts are INCREDIBLY SWEET.

So were expecting it to be at least decent because it can't surely be good if it's just spitting out thousands of donuts a day for the big crowd. We got 6 donuts: maple bacon, voodoo, portland creme, dick and balls, lemon filling one, and a glazed with raspberry filling. My god, these were all horrible! The only thing we found decent was the plain glazed with raspberry filling, because it wasn't drench in all nasty frosting! The dick and balls were a waste, nothing special, not even decorative. Literally just a molding of a dick and balls. The maple bacon was drenched in maple frosting that literally overwhelmed the bacon slice on there. The lemon filling donut was okay... nothing great. And the voodoo special one was just plain nasty. That was a handful of wet sugar. The portland creme donut was the grossest thing ever. The creme tasted like some other ""creme"" it had a nasty flavor to it. Also the guy gave us a small box for 6 big donuts and everything got a little of everything on it. Seriously dude? The donuts look like it was sitting for awhile...that probably explains why it was also dry inside. Eating the donuts between 3 people, we felt sick to our stomach. The sweetness was just too much. And me, I LOVE SUGAR but they just overdo it. 

I had MUCH better donuts in LA. Heck, I think Krispy Kreme makes better glazed ones! It's not soaking in frosting. It was so disgusting. We will never ever wait 50 minutes for a handful of wet sugar again.

Voodoo doughnuts was one of those places that we were eager to try based on the rave reviews we heard from friends and family.

First of all the queue was really long and hot (you have to wait in the huge line that wraps outside, and when it is 90 degrees with no shade, 20 minutes can seem like a long time.  When you finally reach the door, the people behind the counter are yelling at the people in line to leave enough room for the people who just purchased to get out (seems like poor planning on their part when there was plenty of room to wrap the line the other way and not have this door issue.)

Because the inside is so small, you have approximately 2 minutes to look over dozens of flavors and decide what you want before a horn goes off at the counter and you are expected to come with your order ready. (There is also no AC inside which is kind of disgusting when you realize all the doughnuts are sitting there in the heat all day)

In spite of all this, we were still eager to try it and ordered 4 different kinds.  All of the doughnuts were just short of ""Blah"" and not just in my opinion (I know I am a little skewed by admitting that I don't eat sugar) but also from my husband who eats enough on a consistent basis for both of us (plus a little extra for good measure.)

And don't get me started on anything with cereal on it, beware of the stale. Unless you choose to eat that right away, the cereal get stale quick. The donut flavors and designs were pretty creative though, so props for that.

The space is quirky, kind of like a mix of a fun house, arcade, and pepto bismol all in one.

Old Dirty Bastard... ah, sorry I wasn't cussing I promise. That's actually the name of a donut :)
This one is actually my least favorite. Too much going on and a bit dry. It missed the mark. 

Raspberry Donut - my favorite here so far. always fresh, soft fluffy and adequately filled with goodies. 

Dipped donuts are good too. They have several kinds.

I think the best experience, especially if you are not staying in town too long, and only have a chance to make one stop, is to sample and get a box to go. 

Line can get really long (mostly tourists, visitors, or college kids). 

Not a fan of the way they do the check-out. Often they'd have a third cash register open all the way at the end of the room with a person there yelling at customers to grab their attention or waving them down. How about make them closer together or add proper signage to help people notice the 3rd cash register instead of frantically yelling every time a slot opens up?. It makes for a better and friendlier experience. 

If you happen to be in Portlandia, it's worth checking out if you happen to be an avid donut fan. If you don't care about sugarly creativity then I'd skip it due to logistics that come with it - being downtown, crowd, lines, etc.

Voodoo doughnuts come in many shapes and sizes. Inside lots of tasty surprises. In the long line outside, down the street and around the corner, you'll bump into many PDX'ers -- and folk around the country and world -- all hyped-up over a small fried cake of sweetened dough in the shape of a ball, ring or doll!

I do not know if Voodoo ingredients are GMO free. The only organic ingredient they use is Zulka Morena Sugar in their vegan cake doughnuts. Voodoo Doughnut's cups, lids, straws, paper items, and doughnut boxes are all compostable -- impressive! They also support good causes, i.e. Street Roots and more!

You like doughnuts? No doubt, you love Voodoo! Me, I am not a doughnut junkie. I admit, I am chocolate crazy! I'll spend my calories on organic dark chocolate (many known healthful benefits too). OK! I cannot live in PDX without ""One Old Fashion Glaze.""

Let me break down what happened with this place.  While there is good food to be had in Portland, Portland isn't really known for its good food.  And since there was nothing SUPER special to be had, the first thing to really stand out gets a lot of hype around it, whether deserved or not.

Voodoo Doughnut is one of the first places to make ""novelty"" donuts before that was more of a thing.  Are they good donuts?  Yes, they're fine.  They're serviceable, if a bit too sweet at times.  But you're going to be waiting in line for too long just because ""you have to while you're here"".

That's all there is to it.  They didn't get famous because they happened to have a killer recipe for donuts.  They got famous because they made a penis-shaped donut.  So scandalous.

Oh, and by the way to all the Portland natives who are annoyed by all the tourists (and locals) who wait in line for this?  I come from SoCal.  We have this shit ALL OVER THE PLACE in LA!  Over-hyped, underperforming, with lines around the block.

So, after a disastrous experience at Bunk Sandwiches (hated them!!) the hubby just had to have Voodoo Doughnuts because as with Bunk he had seen them featured on TV; so off we went. 

Not being used to the many one way streets we literally drove around in circles before turning down the correct street and luckily we found parking right in front of the shop. 

Once we arrive we were surprised to see a line wrapped around the building and though ""these donuts must rock!""  We eagerly and happily awaited our turn to go inside. 

Once inside we expected the warm and pleasant smell of fried deliciousness but not so much.  I won't go into the decor because I'm sure by know everyone has seen plenty of pictures and know what to expect inside at least visually. 

We ordered the little voodoo guy, a maple bacon donut and coffee...and the verdict is....drumroll please:

Coffee:  Holy willykers batman! It seriously tasted like they used the year old sock of an unbathed transient (which there happens to be plenty in the area) to filter the coffee.  It was bitter, acidic and talk about after taste...just putrid! 

Donuts:  Save your pennies and go to your local Krispy Kreme or anywhere else.  My little voodoo guy had no taste as far as the dough went.

I tried a few different donuts, and the first thing that struck me was the sweetness.

The line was long, and this was around 10am. As I was leaving around 11am, the line was going all thru the other side of the street.
And service.. was not so great. First off, their menu is a mess. It doesn't clearly explain the content of the donuts and it would probably not be appreciated if you asked about each and every donut they have on the menu.

They have glass displays of their donuts in merry-go-round carousels, which was a cool touch. I always like when you get to see what you're potentially ordering. The place only takes cash, though, and most of the donuts (for a single donut) range from $1.50-$3.50. I ordered the Chuckles doughnut based on the staff's personal recommendation.

The doughnut tastes like a Nestle Drumstick with its peanuts, chocolate, and caramel, but in doughnut form. It's a pretty delicious concept but poorly executed. The donut was rather dry and it seemed like the toppings weren't really fused with the donut but instead in its own crusted layer sitting on top.

Upon strolling through the front door, it quickly occurred to me that it's one of those places that's more of a show than it is a superior eatery. There's tons of cool stuff to look at on the walls, including a giant donut that's apparently been stolen on more than a few occasions. The music that happened to be blaring through the speakers during my 5-10 minute jaunt was some kind of cacophonous mess with thrashing guitars and Darth Vader on vocals, and the kids working behind the counter were so detached and disinterested, it was almost a joke. But hey - it's pretty much exactly what I expected. Apparently, every employee there is an ordained minister, and if you feel like getting married at the doughnut shop - you can! And within just moments, too!

The downside is that the doughnuts themselves leave a lot to be desired. Most of them taste like your standard grocery store doughnut, only with odd ball ingredients piled on top like stale cereal and Oreo cookies. They do get creative and their doughnuts will give you a bit of a rise, but that's about all. The penis shaped doughnut and the ""Blazer Blunt"" which resembles lit joint are just a couple of the comical creations that are undoubtedly fun to look at... but not as fun to eat.

Being that bacon is my weakness, I devoured their bacon maple bar... which is pretty much exactly what it sounds like. A maple bar with two slices of cooked, crispy bacon on top. It's no match for the bacon maple doughnut at Dynamo in SF, but really, what is? 

Definitely glad I was able to squeeze this into my travel plans, but I did expect a little more from the doughnuts themselves, due to the massive amount of national attention this place receives.",2010-04-10 16:55:25

My main reason why one bad customer service experience can alter your thoughts of ever returning to the place of business. I had bought a few doughnuts and the cashier overcharged me a doughnut I never bought. When I returned after I left the store, I brought this to the cashier's attention. He was not apologetic at all and even had the gall to just give me the doughnut he had incorrectly rung up without asking to take the price off. I didn't want a $5 doughnut that I had no interest in getting. After having the manager come over and change the price the cashier never closed our box of doughnuts after we showed them we got charged wrong. He just stood there like an idiot waiting for me to close the box! No apologies whatsoever and just a plain ass!

This location (located in Old Town Chinatown) was where it all started and became an international tourist attraction. This was actually part of the walking tour we signed up with and our tour guide gave us the lowdown on some of their unconventional doughnuts. I didn't purchase any donuts from here because the lines were always crazy long looping around the pink dividers but our tour guide hooked us up and brought back a dozen of an assorted mix including their popular Voodoo Doll doughnut. 

We heard stories about their two doughnuts that are no longer available because of violations from the health officials: the NyQuil glazed donut and the Vanilla Pepto Crushed Tums donut. Imagine these ingredients in their donuts... whoa! LoL! You can still have the Cock-N-Balls donut (it has cream filled ""balls""). I had the DIRT donut (raised yeast doughnut with vanilla frosting and Oreo cookies). I couldn't finish it, too much Oreo crumbs... it was a little too much for me, like eating dirt. 

This wasn't our first taste of Voodoo Doughnuts, we've had them at the Universal CityWalk Hollywood (SoCal) and a location not too far from this on NE Davis Street (less lines). I just think that they are great donuts but not worth the long wait. If you haven't tried their donuts it's worth it just for the unique experience. It's a known ""must do.""

We arrived at 2pm on a weekday and we waited in quite a line. There are 3 counters total that take your order. They're cash only but there's an ATM inside if you're desperate. We waited about 20 minutes before getting to the front of the line.

The donuts are dry and stale. We had the voodoo doll, the grape ape, the Homer, Portland cream, and mable bacon bar. I was impressed with 0 of them. The voodoo doll was super dry that we ended up throwing most of the edge pieces out. The fillings were also not very evenly distributed on the voodoo, which has jelly inside, and the portland cream.

Overall, I woud say that if you're in Portland, visit once to say you've been and take some pictures. I definitely won't go back again for the 2nd time though.",2017-05-30 21:54:46

I ordered the standard maple bar. I know that sounds ridiculous to order a regular donut that I can get at any donut shop but I wanted to compare apples to apples. Anyone can be fooled by bells and whistles. I needed to get down to brass tax. The maple bar was good, but I've probably had better at little hole in the wall donut shops with the white greasy bags. My bf had the maple bacon bar and exclaimed it was the best donut he's ever had. It looked good but I didn't have any. I appreciated that there were whole bacon strips on top.

When visiting Portland, a common recommendation is to hit up Voodoo Doughnut.  Evidently, word has spread that this is a spot to hit up and the proof is in the daily long lines outside the door.  Curious passersby likely get reeled in to check out what all the hype is about...

Expect to continue to wait in queue once you get inside the bakery.  No worries, though - time will fly by as you will be amused by the interior decor.  Bright yellow and pink walls are covered nearly from ceiling to floor with framed merchandise for sale, stained glass depictions of their popular sweets, kitschy doughnut and coffin art, paintings of caricatures, etc.  Totally fun & hip vibe with a motley of punk rock, goth, emo scheme.

The myriad of doughnut offerings is just as quirky as the venue.  They definitely earn an A+ for uniqueness.  Many of the pastries are art pieces themselves, almost too cute to eat.  In fact, they do, indeed, look much better than they taste.  We ordered about a half dozen of different selections and they all shared a common trait - gross sweetness.  Crazy sugar overload here, no joke.  Diabetics mos def should stay away from this place as I imagine going into toxic sugar shock/poisoning from eating a whole doughnut, if you dare.  I don't recommend doing so.

One thing I did appreciate was the chocolate milk. Brought me back to when I worked as a lunch lady. I would deliver alpenrose tiny milks to kindergartens classroom. 

My stupid grandson Steven got the cock in balls. Absolutely disgusting. Can't believe he paid money to eat a doughnut shaped like a *enis. It's okay because we accept him for who he is.

I've had their donuts before when co-workers would bring in boxes.  Not a fan at all.  The way some people talk about this place you'd think the donuts were frosted with Ambrosia and sprinkled with the crushed wings of angels.

I can pick up the same things at Krispy Kreme and smash some Cap'n Crunch or crumbled Oreos on top and there ya go.  Except mine will still be fresh and crunchy and I got to buy them with a credit card without the long wait.

  Voodoo Donuts are the taste equivalent of any grocery store donuts but they add wacky things to the top.  Mostly the things they add to the top are things no customer would eat in real life (captain crunch and other sugary crap cereals and 3 day old bacon.)  Let me know which out there amongst you keep your cooked bacon on a shelf for 24 hours or more.

The donuts are way too sweet, way too expensive and take way to long to get.  Expect a 10-30 minute wait and to be treated with the Portland holier than thou barista attitude.  The servers look at you as another bovine consumer to be ignored and then pushed through line as quickly as possible.  I get treated better at a Wall Mart.

If you want a great pastry god to any small Mexican shop or an Asian market. The pastries are not loaded with crap, they don't cost 4 bucks and they are unique and different.  They usually cost about 50 - 60 cents and the staff treat you with respect.

Voodoo, like Pabst, fixed gear bikes and really tight jeans over misshapen asses is a Portland tread based on the ""cool"" factor not on the actual product.  I'm sure if you enjoy being really hip and cool, drink Pabst smear and harbor a misshapen blob under your gray jeans you will enjoy Voodoo.

There was no line when I went but I went at an odd hour. This place is all about the weird flavors, naughty shaped, and crazy add ons, not necessarily the fact the actual donuts are high quality fluffs of sweet heavenly dough. 

Portand has to die for bakeries with award winning chefs and bakers so not sure the hype surrounding this place. I am sure it is just a fun tourist trap kind of place that every city has. Decor is cool though! And I am guessing it is fun to come in and get a phallic shaped donut especially if you are drunk after-hours. ( Voodoo is open 24 hours) 

I chose two donuts on my visit. On the first one I could not taste the donut itself because there was too much stuff and extra flavorings on it. It was also kind of stale/ hard. This was the, ""Dirty Bastard"" flavored donut. The verdict was that it was good but it was like a 5 year old's birthday cake, just too much going on. Sometimes less is more, ya know? 

However, i also got a Guava Colada and that one was tasty and came with an umbrella. Haha!  I loved the coconut and the filling. ( who knew) However, yet again, the cake part was nothing special.",2020-03-09 05:14:24

This is and will be forever more my first and last visit to voo doo donuts, in downtown Portland; it was definitely a unique experience, for one, I won't be returning. My reasons mainly include: rude service, nothing-special-doughnut, and a hype which I don't really understand or wish to share with all the eager late night doughnut mongers. 

The counter help was rude, and had no energy to work up any amount of customer service. My advice would be, don't work there if you are miserable and miserable looking. The counter person asked me if I wanted a bag for my donuts, I said yes, and they reached for a bag and left if on the counter next to my donuts. I waited and realized the counter person wasn't going to bag it. Here I am reaching over the counter bagging my own doughnut holding up the line wondering what went wrong. Then realized I must have offended the person with my faux fur trimmed coat, this person had ""vegan"" tattooed across the front neck. This is the first time I wanted to take my money out of the tip jar.

Besides the rude service, their doughnuts were cold, stale and too sweet. My guess if you're not going to get some outrageous bacon cheese doughnut, just go somewhere like Krispy Kreme. You'll probably get something more fresh and soft. 

The hype, which is bogus, is generated with eclectic and obscure underground music, rugged interior decorations, night creatures, and hand stamped pink doughnut boxes to make people feel ultra sassy, artsy fartsy, and liberated by other ""plain"" doughnut companies. Like a freak show experience, I can see how this can be a novel experience for sheltered folks. 

So folks, this place is more for fast food junkies with no taste, especially with donuts. The place caters to hipsters, wannabe hipsters or idealistic vegan hipsters.

He raved about how cool and popular it was. Sure, they looked extraordinary but I wasn't impressed with how they tasted. Maybe because they weren't fresh? Fast forward to my recent trip which was well after the donut craze that hit up SoCal, NY, and what have you, I decided to pay them a visit and check out what voodoo magic they had under these donuts.

The store was eccentric to say the least. They say a line is normally expected but apparently not on a Tuesday morning when I went. After a few IG worthy shots from every corner of the store, I finally reached the front of the line with no clue what to get. The lady helped me out in getting a dozen various donuts. They were truly all sorts of weird and wonderful in a box, similar to how I would describe this city. I loved the creativity and the colors but they were overly sweet for me. 

My top three would have to be:
*Bacon Maple Bar ($3.50) - Anything with bacon is fab but two long crispy strips? Winner! 
*Neopolitan ($1.65) - Chocolate cake donut covered in strawberry and vanilla frosting with marshmallows. Looks really pretty, too. 
*Mango Tango ($2.45) - Mango jelly filled donut topped with orange frosting. The flavor combo was superb especially since I love orange flavored anything.

All these were again, very sweet but if taken in small doses, they can be a treat. Voodoo Doughnut may be the OG when it comes to gourmet donuts but the competition they have now is far more superior in taste and quality. Come for the novelty but that's it. Cash only!",2017-06-21 15:39:54

I tried the famous bacon maple bar (delish but just a little too sweet and I wish it  had more bacon!), the buttermilk bar (nice and dense) and the chocolate one with the cocoa puffs. I made the mistake of eating the cocoa puffs doughnut a day too late so it was a little stale though I knew it would've tasted a lot better had I eaten it the same day.

They have so many different doughnut flavors, I struggled to pick just one. I finally settled on the Voodoo Doll--I figured it was like their namesake or something. It was okay at first, until I reached the jelly filling. 

ALSO they accept credit cards now! Overall, you should come for the pictures and to say you've been to Voodoo, but go at an off-time.

I purchased 5 donuts in total, 3 of the yeast variety and 2 cake. Two of my selections had peanut butter, cant go wrong there, and the others were sprinkles and fruit loops . The dough was old, cold and stale...it was like eating a sponge. The raspberry filling was the only thing that made this donut 'sweet.' The cereal on the fruit loops was like rubber, very old as well and chewy. All eventually went in the trash after I grew tired of looking at them on the counter of the room in my hotel. 

The store is super small and gets cramped quickly with tourists like myself who are under VooDoo's spell. They even have a time limit posted on their bathroom door of 3 minutes. Employees are even more cold and soulless than the donuts that they are serving.

I have to say that everyone was right. The icing was so thick on these that they left a sticky burn of sweetness in the back of my throat. I powered through the maple bacon bar because mama didn't raise a quitter, but was ultimately left disappointed. Also, it is NOT maple. It's pancake syrup icing.

-Wide variety of donuts
-Merch/souvenirs available

THE GREAT: the Portland cream was so fricking delicious!!!!!! I need to get like 10 more and take them back home with me or I might have withdrawals. The Dirt was also very delicious. 

THE NOT-SO-GOOD: the server gave us a voodoo dozen even if we hadn't asked for it and we felt bad so had to take it. We were allowed to swap out some, but could have benefitted from more clarity and it felt kind of pressured ($20 is a lot for a dozen - especially when som  of it is stuff we didn't really want). It was my bday so we decided to just get them all and then we could leave. The Homer was not tasty. There are no seats outside right now (covid) and that is very understandable, but most places also around kept theirs open and it just made it less of a nice experience.

It wasn't at the top of my list because there's a donut shop with a similar concept back in my hometown (psycho donuts in SJ). But once you see everyone walking around with pink boxes, you're motivated to see what the hype is all about. 

The line was out the door when we came on a Thursday around 3pm as expected. The total wait was about 25-30 minutes. And the wait was not worth it...sorry, Voodoo! Your pink and purple colors and creepy music provided a fun atmosphere though.

All the donuts I got were consistently dry. The donuts are large, topped with frosting, cereal, oreo crumbs, and basically all of your usual ice cream sundae toppings. It's a sugar overload with every bite, but the batter itself isn't anything to rave about. It's a fun experience, especially for kids! 

Still, if you want good donuts in Portland, people recommend Blue Star. I would recommend Pips!",2016-12-30 19:03:39

They only accept cash but have an ATM inside which is only helpful if you have a debit card with you.

But for all of the BS that you have to go through to actually get a Voodoo Donut, they should be just astounding. And they're not.

Voodoo subscribes to the ""more is more"" philosophy, making ridiculous donuts. Some are shaped like genitals. others are topped with breakfast cereal. Others are made to resemble blunts. From my perspective, it's all so painfully calculated to be in the ""Keep Portland Weird"" vein that it's a turn-off. If I want a donut, I just want it to be good. It doesn't have to be wacky.

That being said, to each his own. Some people obviously like Voodoo. In fact a ton of people do, as evidenced by the horrendous line that congregates seemingly 24/7. To their credit, they keep the line moving fairly quickly. This might be part of their reasoning for being cash only.

Voodoo donuts... yeah, you sure did put some voodoo on me... but not the good kind. I have a soft spot in my heart for donuts, especially those warm and fluffy ones. Welp, I'm sad to report that Voodoo's donuts were neither fluffy nor warm. In fact, they were more on the stale side and they definitely didn't taste fresh. I guess I should also add that one of the workers left a real bad taste in my mouth. His attitude really threw me off, but luckily the gentleman at the register was much more pleasant to deal with.
 
One of the biggest turn offs about this place is that they are cash only! Ugh... I hate it. However, I did come prepared since I was traveling, so that cash got spent. I got here at 10:00 am on a Saturday and was able to beat the line. I can't lie... these donuts are definitely esthetically pleasing! If they were in a best looking donuts contest, they would probably win hands down. But, you have to have the taste to really back it up, and these donuts just didn't have that.
 
I ended up getting three donuts: the Captain my captain, Butterfingering, and their seasonal gingerbread donut. The Captain my captain is topped with icing that has Captain Crunch cereal on top. The donut tasted okay, but the cereal tasted very stale. The Butterfingering was probably my least favorite because it was extremely dry. The Butterfinger topping and outside coating was moist, but the inside of the donut was still dry. My favorite one was their seasonal gingerbread donut! The frosting had a wonderful gingerbread taste but the donut still tasted pretty stale.
 
I can understand donuts being a bit stale if I was getting them late at night. But if it's 10 am in the morning, there is absolutely no reason why they should taste like they've been sitting out all day! This coupled with the bad attitude of the employee who was pushing the bucket made me feel like I had chosen the wrong donut shop to go to. Maybe it's harder to make fresh and fluffy donuts with all of those crazy ingredients on top of them, but I'd rather have a fresh plain donut than a fancy stale one. Overhyped? Hell yes! Would I come back? It's up in the air right now, but I would probably try Blue Star donuts before heading back over to this place.",2017-12-07 22:36:34

Parked across the street is a building with the self-indulgent cliche, ""Keep Portland Weird"". And that, apparently, is what Voodoo thinks it is doing. At least, that is what its patrons seem to be celebrating.

But don't fall for it.

Voodoo Doughnuts isn't weird. It's just a sub-par, hyper-commercialized, offensively expensive donut place full of empty promises of creativity and memorable experience.

The donuts are nothing to speak of. They are decidedly ""not bad"". But you won't be paying ""not bad"" prices -- no, you'll be paying the Portland-promotion-premium. That apple fritter you want? That plain cruller you're eyeing? Yeah, check the price on that before you buy.

""BUT"", you say, ""you're paying for the experience!"" Let's talk about the experience. You wait in a long line (probably an hour wait on average, and certainly longer at peak times). The line is poorly managed and ends up making traffic in and out of the store congested and bothersome. As you wait, you'll no doubt be surrounded by tourists and ""OMG I LOVE PORTLAND IT'S SOOOO WEIRD!!!"" natives talking about the very donut store they are now patronizing.

Once inside, you'll be bombarded by merchandise -- including slutty underwear -- brandishing the Voodoo Doughnuts logo. Overpriced merchandise. Everywhere. As you slowly work your way through the packed-in crowd, you'll find a disturbing lack of explanation of the various donut varieties. What exactly is a ""Maple Blazer Blunt"", you might ask. And as you notice the price, you'll wonder what magic they've worked beneath the surface to make it such an extraordinary specimen. If you take the dive, you'll discover that you spent way too much money on what is essentially just a donut with maple frosting and red sprinkles.

So the lack of donut descriptions isn't really a problem. They're just normal donuts with perhaps a strange topping and an unusual name.

And therein lies the kicker. This whole ""experience"" that people speak of? It's entirely empty. Like standing at the corner of Hollywood and Vine, it's only an ""experience"" in that you can say that you've done it. But it's not particularly unique or enjoyable, and you certainly wouldn't care for it at all had the very successful marketing campaign not convinced you to somehow brave Portland drivers in the rain in order to spend way too much money on decidedly ""not bad"" donuts. The creativity of the donuts is...well, you tell me: Is it ""creative"" to put Fruit Loops on top of a donut? If you think so, then heck, I guess you'll love this place.

You want real creativity? How about a ""Cock-N-Balls"". It's chocolate-covered, cream-filled donut. In the vague shape of a crudely-drawn penis. If that's the amazing experience and creative one-of-a-kind weirdness that you want to have as part of your Portland experience, then go for it.

But let's not pretend that it's anything other than a normal donut with a slightly different shape and a name that is nothing more than a cheap marketing gimmick.

And let's not pretend that you're really helping the local community when you buy from Voodoo. Voodoo is ripping off natives and tourists alike, offering nothing special in exchange. You're not supporting Portland; you're supporting Voodoo. But I guess that's what Portland is -- a whole bunch of people wanting really badly to believe that they're creative and weird, but they're really just an audience easily marketed towards (see Obama's record-breaking crowd in the same city).

On the plus side, the donuts are by no means bad. And the variety, while mostly stupid and just a repackaging of your typical variety, does have some gems. The peach fritter, for instance, is a rare find. The Mexican hot chocolate donut is another enjoyable varietal that you're unlikely to encounter elsewhere. Still, the prices are exorbitant and you can just as easily have an apple fritter as a peach fritter. Likewise, a chocolate donut won't suddenly pale in comparison the Mexican hot chocolate donut.

Bottom line: Voodoo donuts are pretty good donuts. But they're not amazing, they're not creative, they're not worth the price, they're not worth the wait, and you're better off going to any other ""pretty good"" donut place.",2012-03-23 06:32:18
