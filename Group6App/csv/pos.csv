So I did - popped in mid-day on Sunday, saw a line around the block, and said yeah, seriously, *screw* that. Definitely not worth it. 

Then we gave it another shot Monday mid-morning before we left for our flight back home, and there were only a few people in line - night and day different. So we grabbed a few things to take back with us, and they were all fantastic. We tried: a Mexican chocolate cake donut, which was glorious (pretty simple donut, but perfect consistency for a cake donut, tons of flavor, and the perfect amount of kick), a cream-filled donut (also the perfect consistency, not too oily like donuts of that sort often are, and in my opinion, a much creamier and less processed-tasting filling than is typical), the famous maple bacon bar (basically just a basic-but-excellent maple bar, with a couple slabs of bacon processed to be crumbly but still basically taste like bacon, which absolutely did add great flavor while still being surprisingly easy to eat without it falling apart), and an apple fritter (my wife insisted on that one - it was a great fritter, and giant, but I wouldn't get it again, being that it isn't a donut, and donuts are clearly their forte.)

I was expecting that such a famous tourist destination would've jacked up their prices sky-high, so I was very pleasantly surprised to discover that they're actually pretty reasonable. I mean, they're not *cheap*, but they're not crazy, either. I thought the prices were completely sane, and I would absolutely come back any time I was in Portland - but only if there *wasn't* a line out the door and around the block. They weren't *that* good. I'd totally wait a few minutes in line for them, though.",2018-03-23 14:17:26

We landed in Portland on a rainy Thursday night, and after a late dinner, mustered the strength to walk through the Pearl to Voodoo. Well, guess what. There's no sign of that infamous long line when you go at 4am on a weeknight in the rain. We got to stand there and weigh our options, pick the cashier's brain on the pros and cons of certain flavors, AND when we finally decided on a few, they gave us a dozen. Because it was the time when they bake new ones for the day.

So we got to try just about everything on the menu. The elvis fritter was really good, so I imagine all the fritters are delish. The maple bacon is amazing, ""tastes like breakfast,"" I said. Then I was like ew this is so many donuts (which I don't even really like) and just ate all the rest of the bacon. MMMM BACON!

Whenever I'm in the great state of Oregon I take the MAX line downtown and walk up to Voodoo donuts. Even though I almost never eat donuts, you gotta have a voodoo donut. You just gotta. They are open 23 hours a day. (I'm guessing the one remaining hour of the day is when they close so that the employee behind the counter can shoot up to stay awake for the other 23 hours of the day.) They are right next to a guitar shop-all the more reason for me to come and visit them. They have all kinds of crazy donuts. I couldn't name them all. They have a wall dedicated to dead b rated movie performers-it has old newspaper articles on the death of the guy who played Mike Brady in the Brady Bunch for example. Another wall when I was there, was dedicated to other horror movie characters, and some local roller derby team. The whole store is so small but even still, there is a little stage above what i think is a closet or a restroom where I'm told bands will perform. Whoever thought you could market donuts in such a spooky way? It must be the place to be on Halloween in Portland or on Kurt Kobain's birthday. Whoever owns this place must be making a killing.

When I got there today at around 6 am, there was only one group ahead of us.  But they took over 10 minutes to order!  That was because they chose every donut for their 2 dozen and also bought t-shirts.

Then it was our turn, and we kindda did the same.  Chose all 12 different donuts for our dozen.  It was about $15, which wasn't bad.  Each donut was pretty good, a bit sweeter then most, and definitely pretty.  The voodoo donut was really good, so was Portland cream.  I tried Oh Captain my captain a bit too late so the captain crunch was not so crunch anymore.  Didnt try the bacon donut.. What you can do is look behind the counter, and they have all the different donuts on the tray.  Ask them to grab you whatever looks appetising to you.  Or you can do my way, which was going through the menu above the girl and read off whatever sounded good.

They have all kinds of decorations in the wall and the most iconic thing I remembered is the art window in front of the store, which is awesome and creative. The servers are friendly and they will literally accommodate you even if the line is long. Our server, Johnny is really helpful and have a great personality towards costumers, so say hello if ever you met him. Anyway..... donuts...

The donuts are extraordinary to say the least. They have the most imaginative donuts that I ever seen. I have a hard time eating my donuts because it is so artistic, that it belongs to a museum or something. My girlfriend and I ordered their classic voodoo donuts; chocolate glazed voodoo figure with raspberry blood in it.. yummmm! My girlfriend likes their double bubble donuts; it literally taste like a bazooka gum. I ordered their famous the diabetically evil Memphis Mafia; based on the taste it is an apple/ banana fritter with chocolate chip and peanut butter icing on the top. Damn it is so good, I would eat this for breakfast everyday in a week. They sell merchandises, too such as a t- shirt and a sweat

48 hours later.... We came back  here before going to the airport because we want to buy our family and friends these donuts. One of my close friend asked me if I can bring him a Chuckles donuts and a Pothole donuts. Of course, I ordered those to myself, too and wow that's why he is my friend because he has good taste. My girlfriend and I ordered 4 pink boxes for to go.. at least 6 donuts inside each boxes.. why not :) Overall, I would definitely go here again, no doubt about it!

While visiting my cousin, in Portland from Denver, she did a great job showing me some of the awesome things that Portland is so loved for. Voodoo was one of those.

I had heard that the lines could sometimes be a nightmare, but on a Thursday night around 9, we walked right in and were back outside enjoying our chosen pastries on the picnic table in the nearby street, in a few minutes.

My cuz suggested we get a few different donuts so that we could sample a wider variety than just one each.  Brilliant idea.  We walked out with a maple bacon bar, a voodoo doll and a mafia something or other (can't remember the exact name).  All were amazing.  The raspberry filling in the voodoo doll? yummy. But my favorite was the mafia. A banana fritter topped with chocolate and peanut butter? Yes, please.  This one was so large that I actually ended up taking most of it home with me and eating it over the next few days.  Still good.

-You have to order properly by ordering something special. You know what, just make sure you have plenty room in your stomach, and go for the maple bacon bar the fist time around. 
-Keep in mind that this isn't high-minded ""cuisine"". It's not low brow dishes executed with the Michelin star culinary technique. It's good, old fashioned, guilt inducing comfort food. If that's what you're looking for, go to Blue Star Donuts.
-Don't go to the Old Town (3rd Ave) location unless you're looking for the ""seedy side of Portland"" experience.

I may have had a lucky experience, but these doughnuts were fresh, soft, doughy,  delectable, deliciously deep fried, sugary, fatty goodness. I'm not a doughnut person. I'd rather have a cupcake. These doughnuts, however, were the best doughnuts I've ever had in my life, and it goes beyond the captain crunch and bubble gum frosting.

Speaking of toppings, Voodoo delivers the quirky, eclectic experience it promises. The sexual references, double entendres and pop cultural references will impress those with an affinity for wordplay. The unique innovation and creative craftmanship will satisfy the starving artist. There's bacon doughnuts for the carnivores, candy and sugar cereal encrusted doughnuts for the kiddos, risque and obscene doughnuts for the adults, blunt doughnuts for the stoners,  and gaybar doughnuts for the activist in us all. If you're conservative, your standard favorites are by your side. This is a place for everyone. You can even bring your vegan friends!

Not every doughnut will suit your palate. I'm not a fan of the cereal doughnuts, but that's not the point. Part of the fun is the experimentation. You're not meant to enjoy these doughnuts. You're meant to savor a unique experience. If you hate your grape dusted or M&M coated pastry, at least you can say you've tried. My personal favorite is the Voodoo doughnut. As a toy and food product, it's the ultimate two-in-one. Every Voodoo doll doughnut is a box of chocolate; with a unique design each time it's frosted, you never know what you're gonna get. The fact my Voodoo doughnut came with a vagina made it even better.

This was better than I expected. Frenetic insanity that doesn't skimp on taste. Such a unique creation could be excused with a crappy product, but the flavor makes this place even more worth the while. If you're too impatient to wait for your chance to open the gates to hell, this is not the place for you. If 20 minutes of stalling is no big deal, you've found your heaven. The only downfall is Voodoo is unique to Portland, but that's what makes Portland Portland.",2015-03-19 08:02:41

We walked on over from our hotel in the early hours of a Friday, through the wet and quiet streets of downtown. It's SO awesome that Voodoo's open 24 hours - we went inside the tiny, tiny store and our eyes danced from doughnut to doughnut - which to choose?? 

I knew from the start I'd be getting the Fruit Loop - glazed with white frosting and topped with bunches and bunches of glorious Fruit Loops - it was a sugar coma from heaven.

Stop #3 of the night was at the now infamous Voodoo Doughnut. The inside was tiny, only room for a short line with no tables or chairs to speak of. The menu was vast with great names for all their treats. You vegan hippies would love this place due to their extensive list of vegan doughnuts. After staring at the spinning display case, I settled on the biggest ""fritter"" looking doughnut I've ever seen. Topped with peanut butter chips, peanuts, peanut butter,  and chocolate, I knew a single bite could give me diabetes. 

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4CxF8c3MB7VAdY8zFb2cZQ?select=g-Q7e9gD8TFv6NIDUnJpPA

The shocking thing was that it was probably the best doughnut I've ever had! The edges were perfectly crisp, as any good fritter should be, and the toppings were simply decadent. Because it was so big, biting into it was difficult. I ended up ripping it apart and saving most of it for my healthy breakfast the next morning. Inside the beast, there seemed to be a layer of some unidentifiable filling. I have no idea what that was, but it helped keep the monster moist and delicious. 

My friend got the fruit loops doughnut and I got a mango filled one for seconds. The fruit loops were sadly on the stale side, but my mango filled doughnut was great! It had this kind of chewy, marshmallow like topping, that was a nice contrast to the soft gooey innards.

I enjoyed the doughnuts so much that I went back the next day for a maple bacon bar to take home and a Tang topped doughnut. The bacon maple bar lived up to its hype and was so good! Nice crisp bacon and sweet maple topping was a match made in heaven. The Tang doughnut was interesting, but not my favorite.

The thing is, Voodoo serves up some pastries that go way beyond the limitations of your average honey glazed ring of adult-onset diabetes inducing boredom.  Thus, when I heard about this place, I sure as hell knew I had to go out of my way to check it out.  And i was just dying for a reason to get out of this weird Tube shaped bar I had somehow ended up in, filled with just the type of people I figured a blue collar city like Portland was void of.  Ah, I'm a judgemental fuck.  Anyways, yes, the rumors are true.  Captain crunch on a doughnut!  Pepto-Bismol flavored doughnuts!  Doughnuts of weird shapes and sizes! Vegan doughnuts!

We enjoyed the scenery, people, and even roamed the farmer's market near by. 
Let me say that Portland is verrryyyyyy different. lol 
Not a negative thing; just different ;) 

An hour+ later, he came out with 16 donuts.  
We ordered such donuts as the captain crunch, voodoo doll, fruit loops, triple choco penetration, Marshall matters, cock n balls, Memphis mafia, etc. 

The star of the show was, obviously, the maple bacon donut. Maaaaaan, I really need to find a maple bar donut and make my own. It was stellar. I had 2 in 1 sitting and a stomach ache during the ride back to Seattle --- SO WORTH IT! 

The Grape Ape was the unexpected 2nd favorite. Not that sweet, with a hint of lavender sprinkles. You'd think something lavender wouldn't taste so uh-maze!


I even packed some in a ziplock to bring back to Vegas. Even when it was a melted maple bar with bacon; it was delicious ;):):)",2013-08-06 02:00:41

And mind you this was a driving trip. I drove through fog, mountains, freezing temperatures, desolate trails and sleepless nights. 1010 miles one way. It really felt like a quest to get these darn things.

Now the location is pretty small that the line went outside but they were so efficient that the wait was no longer than 10 minutes. They had 4 registers open taking orders. The donuts all range in size and variety from the dirty snowball (chocolate doughnut with coconut and peanut butter on the top) to the Memphis mafia(fried with banana chucks, chocolate and peanut butter icing, peanuts, chocolate chips). Now the Memphis mafia was AMAZING. All three of my favorite flavors majestically combined into a large doughy vessel of greatness. The Cock'n'Balls (Yes thats the name of it) is essentially 3 Bavarian creme donuts combined together in the shape of a.....well you can guess by the name of the doughnut. Another glorious tribute to the doughnut gods. 

All in all I was not disappointed with my super random trip and all the hype was well deserved. It's really a shame that their isn't one closer to me here in LA because I would live there.

Double bubble: Any kid would love this! Loved the appearance and the frosting was very yummy and tasted a lot like bubble gum
Miami berry vice: One of my favs! This is the prettiest doughnut I have ever laid my eyes on. Very fruity and delicious! 
Voodoo doll: Its just an average jelly doughnut but still pretty good and very cute
Arnold Palmer: Bleh! Worst one I had! No taste, kinda dry.. 
Dirty old bastard: I'm not a peanut butter person but besides that great doughnut!
Lemon chiffon crueler: I wish there was more of a lemony taste to this but the texture was spot on
Portland cream: Average 
Mango Tango: The BEST! No doubt my favorite! The frosting was amazing and the jelly was to die for. If you like tang and mango jelly get this doughnut I insist!! 
Aint that a peach fritter: This doughnut is HUGE! It was about $3 so pricier than the others but well worth it. I couldn't taste any peach but very nice fritter with wonderful cream cheese frosting. 

These doughnuts range in price but most were around a dollar which I think is a steal for these delicious and unique doughnuts! I hate to see these negative reviews because voodoo is a Portland must!

I crave this doughnut, Plan road trips around this doughnut, Commit myself to the underbelly of Northwest nightlife for this doughnut, Revel in the pure foodie delight of this doughnut . . . Yet I have a mistress! Perhaps not my true love, but damn she's fine . . . and I can't stop thinking about her. She's a little trashy, but in Voodoo doughnut, she fits right in. When I pick her up at the counter, I can feel the wanton stares of slackers with munchies thinking they should be with her instead of me. I know I'm not her first . . . Hell, she's probably been with half this town, but when I'm with her, I don't care. She makes me feel alive, and in that moment, she's all mine . . . the orangutang doughnut. Raised, Glazed and Sprinkled with Tang, they aren't lying when they say the magic is in the hole!

Seriously, I may take my time savoring every bit of the Maple Bacon Bar, but I devour the Orangutang (sometimes twice.) These are my doughnuts . . . and DAMN they're good.

To round out an order I'm partial to (a custom take on ) the dirty old bastard -  a raised doughnut filled with raspberry jelly, glazed with chocolate, covered with crushed Oreos and then drizzled with peanut butter. I also like the Memphis Mafia - a banana fritter with peanut butter and  chocolate.

Next to a hentai (Japanese for anime porn) theater and in a slightly seedy part of town, you can't help but feel you are doing something wrong here. Its 2 am, you're shaking  . . . don't start a fight in the ridiculously long line . . . avoid the cops (you already know how they feel towards crime and doughnuts) . . . find a quite spot in the shadows under the bridge, or in the park along the river . . . and feed your addiction.

I'm not a tattoo man . . . but after a few drinks and a trip to Voodoo, I might make an exception . . . after all, Its Portland!

The donut was just perfect; soft, moist, sweet and savory (if you try the maple bacon bar).  Every bite was worth waiting in line with a bunch of high school students from prom at midnight (yes, they open 24 hours a day!).  They were all wearing tuxedos and dresses with heavy make-up on but were all hungry for donuts ... ah, the youth ... 

The place was so small and it was packed with people.  Slightly buzzed, yet I was able to smell the bacon in the store from the minute I walked in; it was heavenly!

I was hoping to see the donut selection a bit more clearly from the display shelf, but too many donuts are cramped together inside.  I guess locals already know what to order?  I just followed what my friends recommended.

When visiting some family in Oregon, they already know to put this place on the itinerary.  Since the secrets of this place have been featured on tv, there is a bit of a wait to get some donuts. 

This isn't a ""pick up some quick donuts for the meeting"" sorta place.  It's a donutters' destination spot, so once you understand that, you'll see that the wait is actually quite tolerable.  Just use that time to catch up with your friends, or play some Angry Birds or Draw Something, or be a good neighbor and take photos for the tourists in line, who want the perfect pic of themselves and the Voodoo Donuts signage.  

People wait in way longer and more ridiculous lines at some donut spots here in the OC, and yet their donuts could never dream of holding a rainbow sprinkle next to Voodoo Donuts's creations (Yep, I'm talking to you M&M Donuts and your overly fried blueberry donuts!)

The shop is quite small, so they let people in by one small group at a time. Once your group is allowed entrance to the donuts' den, you'll immediately fall into a hypnotic trance from the spinning donut display. Cap'n Crunch, Oreo, Peanut Butter Chocolate, Maple Bacon, Ghost Jelly...the deliriously indulgent concoctions go on and on!  

Whether you like light and yeasty or dense and cakey donuts, sweetly tart fruit-filled or deliciously decadent topped donuts, tried and true, traditional or adventurous Food Network feature flavored donuts, Voodoo's got the donut spells for any and all of your donut needs, that even Harry Potter would jealous of :p",2012-04-01 22:16:38

We went here twice during our trip to Portland. The first time we didn't really know what to get/couldn't decide, so we got the voodoo dozen. It came with a good combination and she even threw in an extra one. We started eating them right when we got out of the shop, all the way back to our hotel. They were so delicious and the flavors were so original.

After doing research and making a list of the ones we wanted, we went back a second time to buy them to bring back home. I really like the Ol' Dirty Bastard and I think the McMinnville Cream is my favorite one. The lemon crueller is really good too! They also have vegan ones, but they are so good that you wouldn't even be able to tell that they're vegan.

The 2nd time, I got 10 donuts and paid $18. The first time when we got the voodoo dozen (when they choose for you) it only costs $10.50. You save a lot of money getting the voodoo dozen but you don't get to choose what you want. If it's your first time I think getting the voodoo dozen would be a good choice since it's really hard deciding!

The first one I ate was the M&M donut. YUM. A cake donut- the perfect consistency. That crunchy outside SOFT inside balance. With the perfect amount of m&ms. 
Next I had the Portland cream. Cream filled donut with chocolate on top. Highly recommend! Got a lot more that I have yet to try. My parents had the mango filled donut and also said it was delicious.

The building is so pretty, with the glitter bricks! It looks like a unicorn threw up all over it. Trust me... IT'S PRETTY. We went around noon, on a weekend/holiday weekend and waited about 10 minutes in line. This is where my friend and I regret the trip. We only got ONE donut each... yeah... ONE. I got Captian, My Captain (my inner Dead Poets self was geeking out) - which was a basic donut with vanilla icing and of COURSE, CAPTAIN CRUNCH. It was delicious, not oily, and very fun. Can you taste fun? Well, I don't know - if you could it'd tastes like Voodoo. 

Overall, the donut was great - better than Blue Star, which I wish my dozen box was a pink one instead. The price is well worth it, I think it was around $1 - bless and overall made my PDX trip sweeter.

Now, I RARELY get doughnuts, but I came back here -- twice! It was busy at all hours of the day with a steady flow of customers going in and out. I love the atmosphere and the workers' attitudes. I think the doughnut names say it all: The Dirt Doughnut, Tex-ass, Cock n Balls, Old Dirty Bastard... you get the idea.

There is nothing traditional about this place, right down to the Maple Bacon Bar. Which has been around long before the weird bacon dessert trend ever started rearing its ugly head... 

I tried a fruity doughnut with some coffee the first time, then the O.D.B., chocolate, peanut butter and oreo chunks, and subsequently needed to order a carton of milk. The flavors are rich and tasty, and I could feel my ass getting bigger with every bite. But it was worth it!

It's not something I'd do every day, but if in Oregon, it's a fun little stop. In fact, I plan on coming by later this summer with my boyfriend when I'm in town again!

When we walked in, they were in between baking and there weren't many doughnuts available.  We browsed the farmer's market and came back to buy doughnuts later.  I loved them.

My visit yesterday was a little different, now over a decade later. When we first drove by at about 11AM on a Monday, the line out the door was very long.  We parked and did some other shopping and then hit up Voodoo closer to 1PM.  The line was pretty short and we were assisted quickly.  Unlike a decade ago, they have doughnuts at all hours.  Big giant bakery racks FILLED with decorative pastries were stacked up behind the cashiers.  The three or four cashiers were friendly and helpful.  They answered my questions expertly and filled my order with enthusiasm.  I tried to be quick so as not to hold up the line behind us, and bought some very pretty and awesome doughnuts.  

My mother and I enjoyed our doughnuts over the course of a couple days and I loved every one.  Very sweet, lots of sugar in the icing and great flavor combinations.  Not all of the treats are overwhelmed with sugar, but most of them are, so come with your sweet tooth.  I highly recommend the lemon-filled powdered sugar doughnut and the mini-M&M doughnut.  The apple fritter was intense and had lots of apples in it.

Despite how the line looked, it actually moved pretty quickly. Once inside the brick restaurant, I was treated to eclectic, funky and fun!

Cash is the only form of payment accepted at this shop that features over 100 doughnut varieties and coffee beverages so be prepared.

On a first visit, I had to try their namesake Voodoo Doughnut that is shaped like a voodoo doll and oozes blood red jelly when you bite into it.

If you are a candy or cereal freak, you will probably find your favorite covering one of the doughnuts. With that said, I had to get a M&M Doughnut and Oreo Doughnut.

While in Portland, you can't go wrong with the ""Official City Doughnut"", the Portland Creme, a take on a Boston Creme.

And, unless you have metal issues (or don't eat pork), a Bacon Maple Bar is a must.

So two tips for eating here.
1) Their menu changes every day, so if you want something in particular you need to call ahead (24 hrs in advance).
2) There's usually a line out the door and around the corner, but don't worry, it moves quickly. From what I saw, this place fills up and clears out in a cycle of about a half hour. 
3) MOST IMPORTANT: There isn't much space in the store to sit or read the menu. They ARE patient and do answer questions about what each doughnut is (we asked a bunch), but the faster you can order the better. The best option (keep in mind #1) is to look at the menu online and have a couple doughnuts that you want picked out. That way, you have some to order even if some aren't there that day. Better yet, just order one of each!
4) They have a little seating area shared by the neighboring business. My recommendation is to plan on sitting for a bit and grab some coffee to go with the doughnuts.

Doughnuts We Bought:
Captain My Captain - so yummy! My favorite of the bunch.
Voodoo Doll - really good, and gets my vote for easiest to share
Portland Cream - simple (in comparison), but delicious!
Triple Chocolate Penetration - chocolate overload, but oh-so-good
Tangfastic - a bit disappointing actually. The one I got was a doughnut with vanilla frosting. Half of it had sprinkles of Tang and half had orange sprinkles. I wish there was more Tang.

I'll definitely be going there again. I'm also thinking of framing the pink box and putting it on my wall - because it's that good.",2012-07-19 04:02:29

I discovered Voodoo Doughnut's when I was scrolling through a friend's Instagram page and she took pictures and I was immediately drawn to it. I added this doughnut shop to my bucket list. Months later my friends and I took a trip to Portland and I told them that we should visit this place! 

Upon arrival, there was a line not too long. Waiting in line wasn't a hassle because we were so drawn to the art on the brick wall outside the shop. When we finally inside, my gawdddd I was blown away! The decor was so cute!

The toughest part - deciding which donut to get. Me being the most indecisive person on this planet, I decided to get a box of donuts because I couldn't just settle for ONE. I got the voodoo doll, Marshall mathers donut w/ M&Ms, the Homer donut, and the fruit loop donuts. Not to mention that the box was super cute! 

For all my donut lovers out there, I would definitely recommend visiting this awesome doughnut shop!

the guy here who told everyone to just get a krispy kreme is insane.  crispy cremes are overly fried, overly sweet nonsense with no originality.  voodoo doughnuts are fresh (stop freaking out tourists, do you see how fast they sell?  they are not sitting out long) and innovative.  because they've been around a bit other folks are imitating voodoo (including cock-a-doodle doughnuts in port angeles, washington), so maybe for some people the novelty has worn off.  for us, they have just proven that their doughnuts are consistently good.  perhaps they will introduce more new doughnuts in the future, but i don't really care--what they got is good already.  we got a box of a dozen including specialty doughnuts for under $17--a basic dozen picked by the staff is around $8.  quit complaining and get some doughtnuts!

for those saying this is a terrible part of town--i'm not sure where you're from, but a few guys asking for spare change in the downtown does not make this a scary part of town.  if you don't know about portland bums then you don't know portland.  smile, give some change or do not, but you will not have a problem if you have common sense.  they are people too.  relax, go at an off time and get a frickin' doughnut.  some stumptown coffee locations sell voodoo too so if you're too afraid to go to the shop, just go to a stumptown coffee.

my husband says that it's the perfect texture of voodoo doughnuts that makes them and the fact that their toppings are sweet, but not overly, hurt your mouth sugary sweet.  i have to agree with this astute observation.

here's the trick folks--this location is open 24 hours.  why the hell are you all going between breakfast and dinner time?!?  go at at an off time and you will not have a wait.  my husband is a morning person so he gets up early and walks down (when we stay at the ACE hotel, between 6-8am) and gets doughnuts no problem.  get there at the right time and you'll see and meet the scruffy owners.  just know what you're going to order when you get to the front of the line if there is one--you'll save the other salivating people some aggravation.",2009-08-15 06:25:50

On the last day of my stay, my sister in law decided to run over and get an assorted box so we could each try a different one or three. Well they didn't cure my cold but they are pretty damn good. I had the maple bar with bacon because the world would be a better place if it were wrapped in bacon. It was bacolicious. I also had a few bites of the one covered in Cap'n Crunch cereal. I would have to say I liked the maple/bacon combo the best. I wanted to try the chocolate and peanut butter donut but after chowing down on more than one, I had reached maximum density and had to push away from the table.

I knew I wanted to try a creme filled doughnut, so I asked for a recommendation. The guy helping us was very friendly and suggested the McMinnville Cream, which had maple frosting and Bavarian creme filling. I was sold. I don't normally eat doughnuts, but it turned out to be amazing. Incredibly sweet and delicious. My co-worker ordered the buttermilk bar doughnut, so I tried a piece and it was also very enjoyable.

We ordered a dozen assorted doughnuts for our co-workers, and I was also able to try the double chocolate, which is simply a chocolate cake doughnut with chocolate frosting.

I was taken to this orginal location by my coworker who lives in Portland.  We went around 1pm and it was a drizzly day but nonetheless, we needed to make the trek to get doughnuts.  I noticed the shop is quite small and dark, but people in line were in an orderly fashion and seemed to be getting in and out with doughnuts fine.  I think there were about five or six people in the shop at the most while the others waited outside due to the small size of the shop.  By the time I got in the shop, I saw how wonderfully fun it was decorated.  Saw a Kenny Rogers portrait there too!  They have this rotating doughnut display so if you see the doughnut in the display case, that means they have it that day.  I bought three doughnuts which were the Vooddoo Doll, Neopolitan, and the Dirty Snowball.  The Voodoo Doll doughnut is a yeast doughnut covered in chocolate on top and has raspberry filling with a pretzel stake in the heart.  The Voodoo Dolls all look different from what is on the website.  Mine looked more like a ghost than Voodoo Doll.  The Neopolitan is a chocolate cake doughnut with strawberry icing and three marshmallows.  The Dirty Snowball is a chocolate cake doughnut with strawberry icing, coconut flakes, marshmallows, and peanut butter.  All the doughnuts I selected were yummy.  I never really eat many doughnuts and so, having three in one day was a new record.  

Aside from doughnut purchases, I also bought these black with pink stripe Voodoo Doughnut logo hot pants, i.e. short shorts for $20.  They were cute and feel really nice and comfy. I wore them to sleep in my hotel room that night, dreaming of more Voodoo doughnuts!

We stopped here twice during our weekend stay in Portland - it was our first stop after leaving the airport and then our last on our way out of town.  On Friday evening we each got 2 donuts - my husband got the Mexican hot chocolate and an Old Dirty Bastard and I got a Mango Tango and Viscous Hibiscus.  My husband thought the Mexican hot chocolate was the best donut he'd ever had - he loved the chili powder mixed in with the chocolate.  I'm allergic to chocolate so I had to settle for the more Caucasian donuts...the Mango Tango was delicious and the Viscous Hibiscus was creative although the flavour of the hibiscus wasn't very noticeable.  The pastry of every donut I had was light and not greasy or oversweet.  On our way out of town we picked up 2 boxes of a dozen each to take to our respective offices, and also had a Grape Ape and a peach fritter on the way to the airport.  The Grape Ape was delicious, but the fritter was all fritter and no peach - I didn't find one single piece of peach anywhere in the donut.

But as a true doughnut lover I say who care. It's worth the wait - their doughnuts are awesome. Not only are they unique with funny names, they actually taste really good. Get a maple bacon bar - it's sweet and salty heaven.

The Voodoo Doll donut is good. The jelly is pretty much all in its belly, but I got a good mouthful of it when I took a bite.

The Grape Ape donut was also good although I was expecting a bit more grape flavor. 

The Miami Vice Berry was similar to Grape Ape and could have had a stronger berry taste.

The frosting on both of these was thick and very sugary. These were both thick donuts and reminded me somewhat of high quality grocery store donuts in terms of flavoring.

The Viscous Hibiscus was excellent. The frosting was very flavorful. It might have been my favorite of the batch.

I recommend eating them within 12 hours. There are no preservatives and putting them in the fridge doesn't do much to extend their freshness. 

It's a no brainer that I would come back again. It's cash only, but you are on a quick trip to sugary blissfulness for under $3.00 per donut.

My baby, Zoey, loved it in here! With the mad music, plethora of crazy smells, awesome visual stimuli and interesting people to look at, Voodoo Doughnut offered Zoey a piece of baby paradise.

About the doughnuts: instead of getting the cock-and-balls, because you're kind of an ass that thinks it's funny to order cock-and-balls, get the maple bacon bar, and 2 other donuts. The cock-and-balls is a chocolate-covered eclair arranged with other doughnuts to look like male genitals. I mean, you COULD get the cock-and-balls, but that's an S-Load of chocolate-covered doughnut and it's expensive-6$ and change.

For less than 10 bucks, we got 3 maple bacon bars, a glazed doughnut and an official Oregon doughnut. This is not bad at all for a tourist trap!

The maple bacon bar could have been better. There needs to be bacon in every bite. In contrast, I went nuts for Oregon's official creme-filled and chocolate covered doughnut. The official Oregon doughnut made me happy enough to award 5 stars.

The glazed doughnut tasted like a glazed doughnut. This is my husband's favorite kind of doughnut in case you were wondering.

I love their vegan doughnuts! haha although I'm not vegan, there have been plenty of times I've considered it and like choosing the vegan option if it is available. So I pretty much always order a vegan doughnut every time I go.

My favorite is the vegan one that looks like cookies and cream (don't know the name, I usually point and order). I also tried the gay bar and that was pretty yummy, basically a creme filled bar doughnut with fruit loops strategically placed on top to make a rainbow. 

It's always fun to come for a bachelor party and get the cock and balls. I came with my friend and they were nice enough to customize it for us!!

They are open pretty much all the time! My friends say they do close at some point in the day, but that they close during the time no one comes out for doughnuts so no one ever notices.... maybe they are 24hrs now...I'm not sure about their hours, but they are pretty much open all the time when you need them.

Price is pretty cheap, but remember that they only accept cash (they do have an atm inside).

On Saturday night we decided the line was probably about as short as it was gonna get and we waited. Even though it seemed long, it moved pretty fast so don't be discouraged! When we finally got inside, it was a bit bigger than I thought it was going to be. They had 3 registers, which is why the line moved fairly fast, and display cases with rotating doughnuts so you can see clearly what you want to order. I ended up getting myself 4 doughnuts: Maple Bacon, ODB, Voodoo Doll, and Sprinkles. They all lived up to my expectations! I ate the ODB that night while fresh, and it was amazing. That was probably my favorite, however it was ridiculously sweet and would probably make me sick if I ate it too often haha. The other 3 made the trip back home with me and I have to say they held up super well. Even after a day or two the donuts still tasted really good. Maple Bacon was a lot better than I thought it might be; it really is a good flavor combo. The Voodoo Doll was  yummy and I liked the raspberry jelly but it also was really sweet. The Sprinkles, which I got so I could try one of their more traditional donuts, was just as delicious and wonderful as the crazy concoctions they're famous for.

My absolute favorite so far at Voodoo is the apple fritter (way better than Bluestar's in my opinion). Super cinnamony, enough apple to taste but not too much, and a nice satisfying crispiness on the exterior so that you know this donut is good and fried. 
We also tried a couple others: fruity pebbles, Oreo, etc. All good choices. I'm sure every donut is excellent.",2016-12-09 03:27:20

This hole-in-the-wall is open late at night until early in the morning, selling to club-going hipsters and people looking to learn Swahili (yes, someone actually teaches it and works there). It's the best-kept non-secret in Portland, and I'm always excited to bring newbies there, just because it's so...out-of-control awesome.

The store itself is pretty small, so there's normally a line out the door (for good reason, too!), but it moves fast. Inside, you'll see oddities like a giant plaster doughnut, and lots of Polaroids of celebs (like goddess Janet Weiss) inside the sugary kingdom.

I ended up picking two, I opted for a classic glazed donut and a Cap'n Crunch donut... Really Really Good Stuff. I'm no donut expert, but it was by far the best glazed donut i've ever had. It was soft, sweet... almost a donut/cake like texture.  My attempt at a description will do the donut a disservice. It was just GOOD, go get your hands sticky and grab one if you really want to know. The Cap'n Crunch donut was reflective of the glazed but with Cap'n crunch and Crunch Berries stuck to the top. Again, also really really good stuff... Straight sugar overload. 

The place is partly tourist attraction and local hotspot. You can't miss the paisley pink building with the long line of customers outside. You'll see tourist in the parking lot taking selfies with the building in the background and locals walking out with pink boxes of their favorite donuts.

Cash only!  Be prepared so you are not standing in the freaking rain for an hour then discover this when you get close to the doors.  There is an ATM inside.

Be smart and show up when the crowd is not there and beat the line.  We last came in here on a Friday afternoon when most people are still working while on a mini vacay and there was virtually no line.  Open 24/7 except on major holidays and one bonus day off for staff in Feb.

Known for donuts that have cereal piled on them, unique flavor combos and shapes, and even naughty donuts, Voodoo has been featured on foodie shows and people have even been married here.  The donuts taste really great, same level as a Winchell's which is better than Krispy Kreme.  Will they make you sing from how good they taste?  Maybe, maybe not.  But the reasons why I give this place 5 stars is because of the creativity, the amazing customer service and the consistency of good, yummy, fresh donuts.

Donuts I like a lot:
*Pot Hole!  NEW guy!  He is a chocolate cream bar, stuffed with yummy chocolate with crushed Oreos on top of him with a dotted white line
*Regular ol' lemon filled jelly donut - I think theirs is the best
*Voodoo Doll!  Looks like an angry chocolate beast bar waiting to be devoured with raspberry jelly
*Coconutttttt - yeah yeah
*Memphis Mafia - chocolate, peanuts, peanut butter, chocolate chips, banana, cinnamon
*Husband's fave is their chocolate cake donuts, he drools just seeing them

They have a huge plain donut that is like the size of seven rolled into one!  If you can eat the sucker in less than 80 seconds they will refund your money!  I haven't tried it yet, I don't want to die from diabetes.

They have Jones soda, milk, Stumptown cold brew coffee, and a soda fountain.  

Last time we were here, the cashier was the friendliest, coolest employee I've seen in action at a place of employment in over two years.  

Place is decorated to match the weirdness - like a yuppie college freshman seeking attention, no longer a girl, not yet a woman, in hot pink and orange with random flashy things thrown about.

They do special orders.  Wish I lived in Portland so I could get the handmade coffin full of donuts.  Sigh.  What a cool 4th of July party that would be.

These nuts also have a record label.  Haven't checked it out yet, but I need to.

I spent my birthday weekend in Portland, first time to the city and everyone one kept telling us that we had to go to Voodoo.

On the first day, we walk by it and skipped it due to the long line. 

Later that night, we waited in line for about twenty minutes with little progress. There were also sketchy people hanging out near the line. We left.

On the third day, we came in the afternoon and found a much shorter line. It took us about forty minutes to get inside.

The donuts are the best that I have ever eaten and even though this place is packed and trendy, the prices are way less than I had anticipated. 

We shared four donuts and spent around six dollars. We got a Voodoo Doll with raspberry filling, maple with vanilla filling, a froot loop topped and a lemon cruller. All of them were fantastic. 

One tip would be to go to their website and peruse the options before getting in line or on your smart phone in line. There are so many choices that it is good to have an idea of what they offer before entering the store. Help keep that line moving!

No use eating a stale or old doughnut. This spot, churning out doughnuts 24 hours a day for boards of hungry donut lovers, definitely has fresh doughnuts.

Prices are normal, considering how crazy popular they are.

Decor is excellent. Jumped in the photo booth for fun, since we were there as tourists more than sweet addicts. They have donut fabric in the back. Heh. $5, they take cards for the photo booth. Bathroom in the back. 

Staff yells at you if you block the exit door. Can't help but think they could have organized the line better, but we debated what the best method would have been and had a few suggestions that also all had flaws. So ¯\_(ツ)_/¯. Haha.",2016-11-14 08:55:31

I have been to Portland a few times before, quite a few years ago but did not know Voodoo Doughnuts even existed back then. It wasn't until five or six years ago that I met some people that moved from Oregon and told me about Voodoo Doughnuts. They did not need to explain it very long. Instantly I wanted to go there.
Steven and I went on a train ride to Portland the other day. A 24 hour whirlwind tour of downtown Portland. We decided to keep our list of destinations small and simple so we could see our priority sites without getting in a wild race to get back to the train on time the next day. We both agreed that Voodoo Doughnuts was one of those priority sites that we had to go to.
We were overjoyed to see that the place was open 24 hours a day so we did not need to hurry. Even at 9 o'clock at night there was a line going outside the door but we figured that we were not getting the full brunt of the line since it was not during the day or the morning. 
Instantly Voodoo Doughnuts exhibited it's wild charms. Approaching the building and getting in line we could see their space that they occupied on the outside was painted in gold glitter on the bricks. Wonderful!
Voodoo Doughnuts only accepts cash so it is a good idea to bring some before getting in line. I think they have a ATM you can use on the inside of the store but don't quote me on that. 
Once we were inside, oh the choices! So much to pick from! I had to get a black Voodoo Doughnuts T-shirt in purple and green design and lettering. Steve said he would buy it for me. Happy Birthday! The cashier that got our doughnuts was bubbly and friendly. It seemed like she actually enjoyed working there despite the throngs of people constantly there. She advised me when I said I wanted a Large t-shirt that the sizes run small and that their shirts shrink some as well. So we went with an XL. Very nice to know! 
Now onto the dougnuts! I got the Mexican Hot Chocolate Doughnut under their Devil's Food category and the vanilla and coconut doughnut. Steve got the same vanilla doughnut and the Gay Bar which had Fruit Loops on it and filled with cream. All of doughnuts we ordered were great but I settled on the Mexican Hot Chocolate Doughnut as my favorite.  It had a wonderful complexity in flavor and tasted just like the drink with a nice touch of heat at the end of the bite.
We are definitely going back!

I've been in Portland for a week now and have tried several of Blue Star's flavors. I appreciate their concept...but really, only one of their flavors was really tasty to me. The others were throwaways (and I actually DID throw two away). 

To those reviews stating that Voodoo Donuts are ""too sweet""...it's a DONUT, not a hoagie. Get over it. That the cereal on top is ""stale""...I don't doubt this, but that's why I don't get the flavors with cereal on them. Everyone knows that cereals like Froot Loops and Cocoa Puffs go stale about 6.3 minutes after being left out. And to anyone that has mentioned the calories, I humbly request that you fuck off and get thee to the nearest vegan food cart. Clearly you don't ""get"" what donuts are about.

I appreciate that Blue Star is trying to elevate the humble donut into the gourmet stratosphere, but look, when I want a DONUT, I want a classic donut. I don't need an organic-lemon-with-poppyseeds-picked-by-blind-Himalayan-sherpas artisanal donut.

Enter Voodoo. Yes, they are over the top. Yes, they're in a shit-ass neighborhood teeming with derelicts. The cash only thing sucks. HOWEVER, the donuts are exactly what I want in a donut...overindulgent, sweet, cakey, perfect. 

My favorites? Diablos Rex (I want as much chocolate as I can possibly ingest in one sitting), Marshall Mathers (mini M&Ms over regular M&Ms ALL DAY) and the Ol' Dirty Bastard (plain raised donut smothered in chocolate frosting and Oreos,?drizzled with peanut butter...total heaven. ODB would be proud. He'd probably take his donut with a side of cocaine, but I digress.)

In conclusion...Voodoo is old-school Portland. Weird,  wild, funky, fun. Blue Star is new Portland: hipster, artisanal, put-a-bird-on-it, tasty. Both are good, but if you really want a classic donut, Voodoo wins every time.",2015-06-26 14:18:42

I had to take him, in fact, each of the two mornings we spent exploring downtown Portland. 

We loved the shop. (Photos to come.) Its very urban feeling with lots of posters and bumper stickers everywhere. Amazing wall art. Rotating donut displays. Fantastic fun staff that makes you feel like, of course these are the best donuts you're ever gonna put in your suck. Even the donuts themselves are fun enough to make you want to try every single one. Of course we try the Mable Bacon Bar, the Voodoo doll donut, the chocolate chocolate, the Bubblegum, and several others over the course of a few days. Lucky our first morning was like on a Wednesday because the line was short and the donuts fresh and the next day it was only slightly busier. Let me say that starting the day with donuts makes eating ANYTHING the rest of the day a major challenge.

After 20 minutes, and one encounter with a clever homeless man (his sign read ""Spaceship low on fuel"") we made our way up the the counter to make our selections. 

It's really impossible to choose just one donut, so we got a box of four. Even that really wasn't enough to satiate us. I don't think you can go wrong with anything they have to offer. We got the traditional Voodoo (chocolate with raspberry filling), one with white frosting and Fruit Loops on top, one glazed with raspberry filling and (the best) one with Rice Krispies, chocolate and peanut butter.

The reason why I frequented this joint was because of the endless recommendations I got. But I had no clue how famous and popular it is! Once I got there, there was a long line out the door at 9pm! Voodoo Donuts is featured on Times Magazine as one of the top ten things to do in Portland. Furthermore, it is featured on the dessert episode of ""Man v. Food."" And I learned on that episode is that you can satisfy both your sweet tooth and wed your honey at the Voodoo! This is just lovely. 

At my first destination in Portland, my ChemE partner-in-crime and I ordered three donuts - Memphis Mafia, Voodoo Doll, and Napoleon. All three of them were gigantic and deliciously magnificent. Memphis Mafia is a chocolate banana fritter that is to die for. It is my absolute favorite ""donut"" ever. The Voodoo Doll is good as well, but I'm slightly more attracted to the doll's adorableness than for its taste. It contains a yummy raspberry jam filling and a pretzel stick in its heart. The Napoleon is like a normal donut - nothing too extraordinary. 

If I were to visit Portland again, I would most definitely swing by Voodoo Donuts for a quick snack. Despite the long line, you can get in and out of the place with in 15 minutes.

Yes they are open 24 hours.....unless they sell out.....which they often do. But they make more, and then they are open again. I know it may be hard to understand that they are so awesome that they sell every last crumb of doughy goodness, but, alas, it is true.

Is the service spectacular? No, generally the staff is actually not very friendly at all, but they don't really have time to be friendly, right? There are 80 people waiting in the friggin rain, beating off pan handling bums, swatting flies from the near-by garbage cans, and making sure none of the patrons from the adult thater next door are trying to make an upskirt movie starring them. They have to work quickly to get your magic in the pink box and move you along.

Yes the shop is small, but take a look around, if you don't have a sense of humor, and you are offended easily, just go to Winchell's, this isn't your grandpa's doughnut shop. There is easily enough crap hung on the walls to keep you entertained while you wait for your turn.

Does it stink outside on a hot afternoon? Yes. Not much I can say about that....

The doughnuts are not loved because they are the best doughnuts you will ever have, it's about the experience, its about standing in the rain, or the hot sun with the smell of a port-o-let that hasnt been cleaned in a hundred years creeping in to your nostrils, just so that you can feel that much better about eating something that you might usually deny yourself. 

Its not about the doughnuts, its about the magic!

Oh, and eff the Maple Baconator, its all about the McMinville/Portland cream, and most of all the Cock-n-Balls, come on! My mom even said it was the best cock she ever had!

As for the doughnuts themselves, I can only speak for the few that we've gotten from past visits:  Voodoo, Bacon-Maple, Cock and Balls, Memphis Mafia and Portland Cream.  The first two are a must, especially for first-timers.  The third is sheer novelty in name and size--not being cheeky at all when I say that!!  I recall the MM being very sweet and filling, but if you are addicted to peanut butter like some people are addicted to crack, this is the doughnut for you.  The fifth because it looked cute.

Made a cross country journey from Arizona to Vancouver and this Doughnut shop was on the way. Once coming there we got to see the port on the way over as well as walking downtown after we had parked. We got to see some of the street life and local businesses. 

As for the experience, once getting in-line we met some friendly tourist that resent design an art exhibit at the Portland art museum. They share with other other locations to check out not only in Portland, but on a way to Canada with other must see locations.

I have heard about the mystique that surrounds the Voodoo Doughnut (henceforth referred to as VD) but had never had the pleasure of being a patron. I spent a good 20 years of my life with the VD name sprinkled throughout conversations of 'you have to try', 'have you ever had', 'man, they are so good'. Then I saw people getting married in this place on a Food Network show, met the maple/bacon bar over the airwaves, and whilst living 3,000 miles away, started to crave a donut. That I don't usually like. 

On my most recent trip to Portland we came upon the VD down an alley, with a pink pill shaped sign and a zombie with a steak in its heart, while going to the Portland Farmers Market. I was sold. There is was. Calling to me. No line, just the VD. When we approached the building, however, we were greeted with quite a long line and a 40 degree soggy PNW day. Thinking ""it'll die down"" we went about our business and returned a few hours later. Still with a line, but obviously worth the effort, we stood and waited for donuts. 

The line was pleasant. Not a phrase I am accustomed to proclaiming, by the way. It moved fast, the building shielded a bit of the cold, we were stationed outside the 'Keep Portland Weird' sign seen in Portlandia (and on the streets of Portland for those who are more familiar, of course), a funny man selling the homeless newspaper cajoled people in line--making them laugh with his sales tactics---, and the donuts were ahead. 

Less than 30 minutes later we were inside with a plethora of combinations to choose from, good smells, happy (if anxious) people waiting to try or get something their palates were craving. I decided amongst the stimuli which included pink walls, unique lighting, and crazy decor...I had to write (err...type on my iphone) our list. Otherwise we would appear (accurately) as VD virgins who were holding up the show. 

I made a list and handed my phone over. Five minutes and one large pink box later, we were out of there. Nearly a dozen treats to delight a little later in the day...though I would have loved to sit and try one right there, it was getting cold. I also regret not trying the Stumptown coffee, but I was in a bit of a rush to get the donuts and forgot about the classic companion. 

Of the donuts we got, the cereal coated was the least admired. I prefer dense, uncomplicated donuts, and also coconut, so I tried the vanilla coconut, a chocolate coconut, and a Mexican hot chocolate variety. All get thumbs up, with the Mexican hot chocolate being my favorite for the kick and surprise it provided. Yum! 

There were cream filled, jelly filled, bar shape, round shape, and colored concoctions in the box. So far no one has complained. 

As someone who would not claim to be a donut fan, these are well done and quite tasty. They are fresh, flavorful, and interesting. All good things. 

After all this writing, I think I'm going to rummage through that pink box to see what remains. Try the VD....it worth the wait, and your taste buds with thank you. 

Also, avoid the real VD by practicing safer sex, and have a nice day ;)",2011-12-12 17:54:16

The key to avoiding a line is going early on a weekday morning. The infamous pink box will be in the arms of many patrons as they complete their transaction. You will be chomping at the bit, but it's worth it's weight in calories.

The smell of breakfast entices you to move forward in line, even though your brain is telling you to run far away from the epicenter of anti-diets. Make sure you read the chalked billboard menu before you reach the front of the line, because locals know what they need and will be in a hurry. As a heads up, there will be choices for both vegans and carnivores alike.

After single-handedly eating over 3 dozen donuts from the original location and about 6 from the Davis location, I think I have a pretty good idea that the original is worth the wait.  I may give the new location another try to see if they were just a bit off that time.  

Oreo donut, maple bacon and old dirty bastard donuts are still my favorites.  The crunch of the oreo in addition to the chewiness of the dough is the perfect combination.  (Another reason the Davis street location let me down is that the oreos had NO crunch :( and the bacon was no as crunchy either.)

The reviews are mixed and you see this shop in magazines all the time in the donut rankings, but we wanted to try it out!  He mentioned to know what we wanted before we go in, and he was right, although it doesn't seem like they have descriptions of all of their donuts online, they need to have that!  Yes, the customer service could be better, but I get that they want to get people in and out as quickly as they can.

We stopped in to Voodoo on a weekday evening probably around 6 or so, and only had to wait inside in line behind probably 2 groups, so not much of a wait!  We ordered three donuts - the bacon maple bar, dirt doughnut, and the no name doughnut.

They were all great!  My least favorite was the no name doughnut - doughnut with chocolate frosting, peanut butter, and rice krispies.  I noticed the peanut flavor more than the chocolate, so I was wanting more chocolate, but this was my husbands favorite!  We both liked the bacon maple bar, the maple frosting was awesome, but my husband felt it needed more bacon or the bacon to be chopped up so you get bacon in every bite as a huge chunk would come off if you had a bite.  My favorite was the dirt doughnut with oreos and vanilla frosting.  Loved it!

I wish we would have had more time to stop in again because there are so many interesting flavors - they really need a sampler!  Maybe next time!

The really only negative, is that it did not seem like it was in that good of an area, on the side of sketch, beggers out there in full force, so we got our donuts and quickly left.",2016-05-12 17:00:33

The bacon donut - Excellent.  The bacon isn't too salty, and I think they add some maple, this donut worked very well, and I thought it was a smart choice to not use a chocolate icing.

The dirty donut - Possibly my favorite.  It's covered in crushed Oreo cookies.  

The voodoo doll - I should have eaten the bottom first, but even if I did, I was a little dissappointed.   It was still a decent donut, but I wished the top had filling as well as the bottom.

The Fruit Loop donut - This donut looked interesting since it was covered in Fruit Loops, but the Fruit Loops were a bit stale, which made the donut just OK.

Ordered the maple bacon, portland creme, cock and balls while my friends ordered more of the same along with a sweet mango tango. Overall, all of them were amazing, melt in your mouth donuts.

Goofy eats, quirky help and constant reminders on the Travel Channel.  Even Anthony Bourdain gave it a thumbs up.  From what I have heard, Tony still has flashbacks to the Maple Bacon wonder.

Well the hype is true.  VooDoo is more than a doughnut shop; it is a shrine to the sublime,  a temple to the taste buds, and Mecca for the fans of this culinary masterpiece. A trip to VooDoo on your first visit is more like a pilgrimage, a wonderful convoluted combination of Portland Hipster culture and a true 5 Star doughnut experience.

Describing VooDoo is a moving target because it is a constant state of flux where the owners never are satisfied with conventional wisdom and relentlessly pursue the unique and the delicious.  Every visit to VooDoo is, an essence, a flipping of the bird to large corporate doughnut chains that forgot why they got in the business in the beginning.  Sure, Krispy Kreme has a wonderful assembly line approach to cranking out the crispy critters.... and they have heart.  VooDoo doughnuts has soul.

Trying to capture the essence of VooDoo is like digging a hole in the sand in the beach.  Just as you start digging, the waves crash and hole you were digging magically fills up.  The magic is truly in the hole.  Embracing the existentialist nada, every day is filled with great opportunity and unlimited possibilities.  Do not fear the whole.... embrace it my friend.

Let me just say it put a spell on me.  Where I live, in the land of plastic, we don't have that many donut stores, let alone donut stores that I feel compelled to write odes to. We have a 24 hour donut place in my neck of the woods but the flavor is no where near the intense pleasure I got from Voodoo donuts. Hi, I'm Christine and I'm a sugar-holic. 

Voodoo doughnuts was my first stop when I arrived in Portland. (aka PDX by the locals. Fine, I call my land The OC, so we're even). When I arrived the line wasn't bad, since it was drizzling out, or maybe I just got lucky?

The pressure to choose which donuts I was gonna have was intense. NOTE TO OWNERS: I wish there was a menu posted outside so I could be thinking about what I want before I stepped in the door.  Choosing just a couple donuts from 90 on the menu cranked my anxiety level up to 11. Some reviewers left notes about the service. It's a Doughnut Store, people! The girl that helped me was great, she took the time to find me the right size of shirt, and knowing I was a tourist, she even asked me if I wanted a pink box. I don't expect 3 Star Michelin service in a doughnut store. (And it's not like the employees were like the Soup Nazi on Seinfeld.) 

I chose the Portland Cream, a Maple Bar, Chocolate Cake and the Peach Fritter. The Peach Fritter is like an apple fritter, except, well, you get it. Slightly crisp on the outside and soft, melt-in-your-mouth deliciousness on the inside. Then, to take you completely over the edge, they cover it with luscious white frosting. I was in a complete sugar and carb coma after I ate it, but it was the best doughnut I've ever eaten!  I seriously had to restrain myself from not eating all of my sweets at once, but days later, the Chocolate Cake doughnut still tasted awesome. 

My theory is that not only do these people REALLY know how to make yummy doughnuts, but the fact that they are making them 24/7 means you get the freshest donuts possible. 

The names of the donuts are risque, so I'd advise that you not take children in who can read the menu and have any bit of smarts about innuendo! Need a dozen donuts for a Bachelorette Party?  Then the ""Cock and Balls"" are for you.  Over-the-Hill party sweets for an aging man?  How bout the ""Old Dirty Bastard""?

Decor inside is twisted. No really. Don't forget to check out their T-shirts. My teen son LOVES his shirt with the Voodoo Doughnut logo.

I feel as if you need to judge Voodoo on a different level. You should understand that in terms of pure doughnut goodness, Voodoo will not get top marks. That is not their shtick. This is not some old man who has made doughnuts for 50 years and slowly perfected them. If you want that, you can find that elsewhere. This is a hip, trendy place that serves creative doughnuts. Part of the fun and excitement of going to Voodoo is that you can get 'alternative' styled doughnuts. I feel that if you combine that with a reasonable amount of good taste, then this place deserves 5 stars. There's a reason it has 3000+ reviews.

Whether you saw it on the Food Network, the Travel Channel, read about it here on Yelp, or got a rec the ol' fashioned way (i.e., word of mouth), you know you'll find yourself there, patiently waiting in line, debating with your friends as to just what kinds (and how many!) doughnuts you'll order.

The question then becomes, how do you avoid waiting in an hours-long line to get your hands on a precious maple bacon bar?  Easy - Voodoo is open 24/7 - so pick an off hour, and hope for the best.  Our group mosied up around 9:30 p.m. on Memorial Day, and were pleasantly surprised to find a line of only about 20 people.  We made the queue, and patiently waited for about 20 minutes or so.

When we finally entered the sacred pink storefront, our senses were overloaded.  What to order?!  What to order?  We opted for a do-it-yourself dozen, which included the famous maple bacon bars, a raised oreo ring, some good ol' glazed, a Bavarian creme, and some assorted others.  There are no price breaks here - each doughnut is individually priced, so our dozen was about $24.

While the maple bacon bar was phenomenal, I have to give my ""personal favorite"" vote to the oreo raised ring.  It was sweet but not too cloying, the doughnut was light and airy, and the oreo crumbles gave it a nice crunch.

Being college students, we put our problem-solving skills to the test and after ten minutes of intense brainstorming, dropped in behind a German family inquiring about every item on the menu. This gave us plenty of time to do the same within ourselves, and for me to form a puddle of drool on the floor as a direct result of staring at a particular donut revolving in and out of the spotlight.

This was, in my eyes, the holy grail of donuts: the Old Dirty Bastard. Slathered with chocolate glaze, peanut butter, and crushed Oreos. While my friends debated between the blueberry cake and the Arnold Palmer, I knew what I wanted.

Long story short, walked out, took a bite, and turned around to go buy fifteen more but the line had already boomed to midnight-showing-of-Harry-Potter proportions.

They got put on the map with their untraditional donuts (NyQuil glazed, Cock n Balls, voodoo doll donut), but dang if they don't earn the hype. I had to go with the Maple Bacon and the Portland Cream (chocolate cream-filled donut). I've had maple bacon donuts from other places before, but this is by far the best. All of their ingredients and flavors just taste ""REAL."" You can really taste the maple in the maple icing, and the bacon strips are thin and crispy, just the right amount needed to counterbalance the maple. I think most other places tend to go crazy with the bacon, but there is such a thing as too much. The chocolate on the Portland Cream donut tasted like real chocolate, not just chocolate-flavored sugar, and the cream part had a nice dense consistency. Best of all, the ""dough"" part was soft and didn't taste greasy at all. The store is small but chock-full of all kinds of fun things to look at.

Just go! You totally won't regret it!

I have never had a more perfect doughnut. All of the doughnuts have their own unique flavor and I love them all! My favorite BY FAR is the MAPLE BACON ""BAR"". I actually went to Voodoo today and asked for a maple bacon bar and the girl said ""can you wait 10minutes because the bacon is still hot"" and I said ""no, not really, I am kind of in a hurry (I had to pick up Thai food- I'll write a review for that next!)"". The hot bacon made the maple glaze gooey and even more delicious! I really, really, really recommend Voodoo to ANYONE. Even if you don't eat doughnuts, it's still a fun experience. 

I went to the Voodoo Doughnut downtown at around 12:30am on a Friday night and there was a line around the building...My local Portlander friend reassured me that ""don't worry babe, you will love this shit, it's sooooo worth the wait, you have no idea."" At first I was extremely skeptical- flashbacks from when I used to live in NYC and Magnolia Bakery was said to be ""the best thing since sliced bread"" and I waited in line for an hour for a damn cupcake, only to be disgusted by the not even worth the ""tasted like cardboard"" description came to mind. However, I trusted my friend this time and we stood in line, surrounded by drunks and tourists..and drunk tourists, enviously watching the people exiting the store and taking pictures, doughnuts in hand, with huge smiles on their faces. We finally got inside and got our doughnuts. A-M-A-Z-I-N-G. You just have to try it yourself. There is also another location on 12th and Davis that is a lot bigger than the one downtown. The doughnuts taste the same, the people are just as nice and you rarely get any drunk tourists in there. I have never had to wait in line there, but I could be lucky.

There is a doughnut for everyone at Voodoo! There is even a HUGE cream filled doughnut that is shaped like a penis...and for a buck more you can have them draw crabs and write someone's name on it in icing! It's pretty funny if I do say so myself!

I've heard sky's the limit recommendations about Voodoo from multiple people, and it met my expectations. I used to work at a cake bakery that also sold donuts, so I know a good donut when I taste one. Voodoo has the best donuts I've ever tasted. Before I walked in, my Wu-Tang appreciation unexpectedly kicked in when I saw the menu, so I ordered the Ol Dirty Bastard. It's a combination of a chocolate glazed donuts, crushed up oreos, and peanut butter. If I could create a desert that perfectly symbolized me, I would aspire to make an ODB donut. Now that I think about it, I'd eat anything called Ol Dirty Bastard! The reason Voodoo donuts are so great is because the consistency and texture of the glaze is perfect. Most donut glazes become more solid and a bit crumbly after an hour, but the glaze at Voodoo had the texture of butter cream frosting you'd find on a chocolate cake. THIS IS THE KEY TO MAKING AMAZING DONUTS.

1. If you brave the line, make sure to get an ample amount of donuts. You will love them, but won't want to go back in line for more.

2. The bacon maple is donut god; bow before him/her.

3. The banana fritter can feed a family for a week. A good thing and a bad thing?

Paul was really excited about the maple bacon doughnut, he had been waiting to try it for weeks and weeks, since I first heard about it.  I heard Anthony Bourdain just visited there too and was a fan of the bacon doughnut, so that made us want to check it out also.  

I tried a vegan cupcake...errr, doughnut that had crushed butterfinger topping on it.  It was really great, the flavor was fantastic.  I really enjoyed it although it took me several hours to finish it, it was really sweet, too sweet to eat at once.

Paul, of course got the maple bacon doughnut which he really liked.

I had to wait in line for about a half hour before I could get in and select my doughnuts. Although waiting in line typically sucks, it added to the experience. 

I decided to pick six of the 70+ doughnut options and went with the following choices;

Triple Chocolate Penetration, Voodoo Doll, Memphis Mafia, Maple Bacon Bar, The Old Dirty Bastard, and the Loop.

Here are my grades for each;
Triple Chocolate Penetration- Chocolate devil's food cake doughnut, chocolate frosting, Cocoa Puffs.
Grade- C
Extreme chocolate flavor, the only negative is that the Cocoa Puffs were a little bit soggy.

Voodoo Doll- Voodoo doll shaped doughnut with raspberry jelly filling and chocolate frosting.
Grade- A
If you like jelly doughnuts, you'll love this one. The chocolate and raspberry combination was very tasty. 

Memphis Mafia- Apple fritter with peanut butter and chocolate toppings with chocolate chips and banana chunks.
Grade- B
This was an enormous treat that I could barely finish. The combination is not one that I would have ever thought about, but it tasted really good. 

Maple Bacon Bar- Maple bar topped with bacon.
Grade- A
Amazing! Tasted like French toast with bacon on top. 

The Old Dirty Bastard- Doughnut topped with chocolate, Oreos, and peanut butter.
Grade- A
My second favorite, after the Maple Bacon Bar. That great chocolate/peanut butter flavor that everyone loves.

The Loop- Doughnut with vanilla frosting and covered with Fruit Loops.
Grade- A
I love Fruit Loops, so I loved this doughnut.

It doesn't hurt that we stayed a block away from it, so it was super easy to walk to and we could look out the window to determine how long the lines were. Thankfully it's open 24 hours a day which means you can fulfill that donut crave at any time. 
It's a relatively small store with two registers and spinning carousels of donuts. They come in a bright pink unmistakable box. Creative flavors like captain crunch or their signature voodoo doll filled with raspberry jelly are sure to pique your interest. To be honest maybe more than one is too much sugar for a daily intake but it's great to share and save for another day (though fresh is better). 
There's a photo booth in the back and a Jones soda fountain. Of course there's coffee too. Only a bar to stand up and eat and a few tables outside if it's not raining.",2017-06-09 17:06:43

The doughnuts are very generously sized for the price with fun ideas for flavors. I ordered the maple bacon bar, the voodoo doll, and a peach fritter. The fritter was by far my favorite, not overly sweet and with big chunks of fruit. It came with a lot of icing, however, and I removed some of that to avoid being totally comatose afterward. 
The staff was friendly and although the line was long it moved quickly and I felt that there was plenty of time to review the menu while I was waiting. 
Definitely a fun experience.

This place is open 24/7, but there will probably be a line, and they may sell out of one of your donut choices (the maple bacon, in our case).

They don't claim to have the best-tasting donuts on the planet, nor should you come here seeking the best-tasting donut on the planet. That being said, the donuts taste great and they DO have the most creative, funky, unique donuts I've ever seen on the planet:

- Anatomically-shaped donuts (C&Bs).
- A glazed donut bigger than your head (Tex-ass).
- Huge fruity fritter donuts that are the perfect combo of crunch and fruit.

Yes, I had heard about the long lines and had set my mind on waiting in them but I decided to turn back and attempt a voodoo donut run the following day. 

I came on Monday morning around 10:30 am and had better luck. I arrived to a line of about 30 people ahead of me. Most of them appeared local and a few like myself were snapping away and taking pictures. I could feel my heart beating fast with excitement at how close I was to having my first voodoo doughnut. As I looked all around in anticipation I finally made it in into the little pink store. I enjoyed the turning samples of donuts. So many to choose from in such little time. 

We we're assisted by Josh. He was awesome. We told him it was our first time here and our last stop before heading home. He recommended some delicious looking donuts and he was very polite and helpful.

You have so many options, SO MANY. You most likely will stand in line with some dance music playing in the background and just a place full of young people! The energy when you enter is like no other! Word of advice is start figuring out what kind of doughnuts you want because the line moves really fast!! I'd recommend looking for the flavors online and make a decision because once you get to the front there is a sense of hurry in taking your order and rightfully so because there are so many customers even if this place is open 24 hours a day! Or you be the cool guy/girl and say surprise me!

Anyways I ordered the Dirt, old dirty bastard, captain crunch, grape ape, voodoo bubble,  the homer, Portland cream,  voodoo doll, maple blazer blunt (no it's not a edible ), diablos Rex, triple chocolate penetration (and yes I got i because of the name also), aquamarine. passion fruit jam

Dirt is the oreo with vanilla frosting. Tastes like Oreo in donut form
Old dirty bastard is the same as dirt but with chocolate frosting and peanut better
Captain crunch is just as you imagine it, the beloved cereal on top of a doughnut
grape ape is that grape taste on the doughnut (more like candy grape flavor as opposed to natural grape)
The homer is a must have for any Simpsons fan which is the iconic doughnut brought to life with strawberry frosting with sprinkles
Portland cream is Bavarian cream with chocolate frosting with some cute eyes
Voodoo doll- The most popular doughnut with raspberry jam. While the doughnut was good , the jam was okay.
Maple blazer blunt- Looks like a blunt with maple flavoring and no you cannot smoke it
Diablos Rex- Is a doughnut with a pentagram for those who like to summon a partner eating with them. Although this doughnut was also okay, not great
Voodoo bubble- Of you love bubblegum, Just get it, don't argue with me. Frosting with bubblegum dust on it
passion fruit jam- It was just like a jelly doughnut except it had passion fruit!! very unique flavor!
aquamarine- Looks like a star from Super Mario except orange and tastes like orange! Mamma orange!
Triple chocolate penetration-Great flavor, just like coco puffs with chocolate frosting!

That's it folks, If I come by Portland I will try all the flavors I can!
Highly recommend this place!

I stayed in downtown Portland a year ago for a conference.  Spent the nights at the awesome restaurants and bars.  One night at about 2am, it was decided we would go to the famous Voodoo Doughnuts.  The place was hoppin' a bit and the line quickly disappeared and I was at the counter.

My goodness... what to do... what to get?  There's a donut with bubblegum on it, there's one with tang on it, there's one with crushed Oreos on it, over there is one topped with Captain Crunch cereal, down there is a massive one shaped like a penis, oh my god that one has bacon on it!

This my friends is what happens when people decide to just have fun and make something the way they want to.  People had always thought things like this could be done, dreamed about it, perhaps even amateurly attempted it themselves at home... and now here at Voodoo Doughtnuts, they've perfected it.

I ended up getting the maple bacon, fruit loop, and old dirty bastard donuts.  The fruit loop donut was very sweet, but if you like fruit loops, it was awesome.  The Old Dirty Bastard is chocolate, crushed Oreos, and drizzled peanut butter, it was amazing.  The Maple Bacon donut... you may have seen this at other places, but they don't cheap out here and they make it right.  Anthony Bourdain showed it best.  Once you have this, you'll only want it again.  You will never be able to eat a standard donut from down the street ever again.

In the end... come here.  Eat the donuts... find your favorites... dream about them and always get them... and always try the different ones to see just what each one is all about.

Vodoo doll donut - It's such a cute donut and they say don't play with your food, but I looked like a little kid having the time of my life stabbing the donut w/ the little pretzel stick that comes with it LOL. It's a raspberry jelly filled donut w/ chocolate frosting. Yeast raised so it was nice and airy. Very good jelly to donut ratio and the perfect amount of frosting! Really good donut, I wouldn't mind ordering another one of these.

Memphis Mafia - Think of a banana fritter w/ glaze, drizzled PB & chocolate, sprinkled w/ peanuts and chocolate chips on top! HEAVENLY!!!!! Damn why can't they make something like this back in the OC? Very good and I liked it more than regular apple fritter.

Maple Bacon Bar - Notice in my picture there's 2? Hell I should've got a half dozen of them! They were so good!! The bacon was so crispy and I'm not sure what bacon they used, but the flavor paired well w/ the maple frosting and donut. It was the perfect sweet and salty mix.

We got different kinds that included a Voodoo ghost donut, cock-and-balls donut, grape ape donut, mango-flavored donut, cereal topped donut, etc.  Yes, I saw the bacon topped donuts.  Dafuq?!?!?!?

I had squandered my Portland moment on what I later found out to be Mango Tango- a mango jam filled doughnut iced and covered in tang powder.  Still cloyingly sweet like every other doughnut that has ever disappointed me, this one had a wonderfully bright, citrus acidity to counter the sweetness.  The jam had a great, fresh mango taste that I wouldn't think possible for a gooey, neon-orange substance jammed into a doughnut and the powder set everything off better than I could imagine.
It was motherf.cking delicious and honestly, the first satisfying doughnut I've ever eaten.

Doughnuts included:
- Chuckles: risen doughnut with a chocolate and caramel drizzle, mocha powder and peanuts
- Portland Cream: A chocolate iced doughnut injected with a creamy custard
- Loop: Doughnut with Fruit Loops on top - beautiful
- Mango Tango: Doughnut with a fluffy apricot/peach-y fluffy frosting with a sweet mango jelly
- Dirt Doughnut: doughnut with vanilla frosting and a pile of crushed Oreos
- Marshall Mather's: Vanilla cake doughnut with mini M&Ms atop
- Butterfingering: Chocolate cake doughnut with butterfinger on top - literally tastes like the candy
- Sprinkle: Vanilla cake doughnut with colorful sprinkles
-Chocolate Coconut: Chocolate doughnut with shredded coconut flakes
- Cinammon Sugar: Basically churros but more doughnut
- Blueberry cake : glazed blueberry cake doughnut 
- Doughnut with chocolate, peanut butter and rice krispies - don't recall the name though

After taste testing all of the flavors, we each picked our favorites: Butterfingering, Chocolate/PB/rice krispies, Portland Cream, and Mango Tango.

Since the food network show we saw they have renovated or expanded and so the interior was not quite what we'd seen photos of. The staff was friendly.

Ok, there we go.

I think they should change they're name to ""Fat Guy Heaven"". Do you like to dip, or ""accidentally"" get, your bacon into your pancake syrup? Of course you do! Voodoo has taken in one step further. They put bacon on top on maple bars. GENIUS!

I know I could stop this review there. That alone is WELL worth 5 stars, but they offer so many more doughnut options. Voodoo truly knows how to put the special into specialty doughnut. Imagine this... a doughnut with chocolate rice crispys, and peanut butter. Wait... don't imagine it. Just go pick yourself up a No Name from Voodoo!

Voodoo has only let me down one time. I had a few friends from a touring band crash at my apartment. I thought I would treat them to some of Portland's finest. I got up at 5am to get some Voodoo before my friends had to take off. I drove out from Beaverton only to find a sign that they were sold out. Sold out at 5am on Sunday morning?! Isn't that against the doughnut shop code of conduct? Oh well. I forgive them.

We get there and my first instinct was, ""we're gonna get thrown out."" On that particular moment, the homeless (which were few and far in between in Portland), the punk rockers, the pierced and tattoo'd were all there this evening. It's a small space about 10ft x 8ft. My wife and I just came back from a nice homely dinner at Mother's. We were dressed 'out-of-place' nice which is unusual for me. I don't like feeling like the 'suit' in the room. Regardless, our sugar craving can withstand any obstacles. We proceed. We're 2nd in line and before I even look up at the menu, the guy in front has placed his order... crap... pressure. The guy behind the counter wasn't the type to wait around to see what we want. There was also a line starting to form behind us... shit, pick something damn't. F--- it. ""I'd like a chocolate donut with the creamy filling."" Apparently, they come in a few shapes and I was told rather rudely. ""Shit... okay, just the round filled doughnut."" Whew... pressure's off. In the meanwhile, I look at my wife. She's still looking up at the menu. She's smiling, taking her sweet, ole' time. I can tell Mr. Voodoo on the other side of the counter isn't going to take anymore of this. But my wife's sweet and cute, he can't possibly snap at her. And he didn't. But I can feel his brewing impatience about to errupt. Stressful seconds later, she finally makes a gesture to order. Semi rudely, he says ""So you made up your mind?""  I sort of giggled inside. This place rules, I think to myself. What a relief to find a place that's just 'real'. It's refreshing to walk in a place and get some honesty for a change. This place isn't even close to trying to be a comfy, feel good, let's-all-hug, kind of place. It's a little angry, in-your-face actually. So we get our doughnuts, we pay and to my surprise the man behind the counter became just the nicest guy. I forgot his words exactly, but it was genuine. We were so full that night that we actually had to wait to eat our doughnuts until the next morning. Bad idea, right? Wrong! The doughnut was excelent! Yes, even bagged and a day old. That should say a lot about what it could be fresh with your Stumptown Coffee. I highly recommend this place. Don't be intimidated by it's ""locals only"" vibe. It might feel that way, but they're genuine, unlike what you'll find in the pre-packaged, pre-screened, pre-pared customer service you'll get at Starbucks.

As for the bacon maple bar, simply imagine eating a breakfast dish in which the maple syrup that you poured onto your pancakes have encroached into the territory of your bacon. If that doughnut is beyond your comfort range, we would suggest the doughnut with the Oreo topping which are highly addictive though may cause immediate diabetes.

Lastly, if you are able to catch one of the staff a bit before last call, you may be able to score yourself a bucket of doughnuts for five bucks. Yes, an entire bucket of Voodoo Doughnut doughnuts for only five dollars.",2010-04-04 00:04:13

The staff is friendly, helpful and patient. The main and only drawback to this place is the long line every time (pretty much no matter the hour in the day). The wait is extremely long and takes a very long time to make that tough decision on which one to go with. 

The wait however is definitely worth it! The doughnuts are outstanding! I can't even begin to imagine the amount of work that goes into making sure there's enough for all clients, at all times.

Buy them all at 10PM and eat them until you're in a sugar coma. You won't regret it.

There is always a bit of a line at Voodoo which might deter many, but once you've had a maple bacon donut, you'll wait in line with glee. I've tried about 20 different donuts here and can't stop trying new one. But if I'm getting 4-5 of them in that adorable pink box, there will be at least 2-3 maple bacon donuts. No joke, no one even comes close to Voodoo regarding this donut (the maple bacon). The best gift I ever gave to someone was when we flew in to O'Hare and were picked up by my brother; he received two maple bacon donuts from Voodoo that I picked up for him that day. He couldn't have been more pleased.
I dream of Voodoo doughnuts. If I lived in Portland, I would weigh a lot more, so maybe it's good I only get these every now and then.

I acquired some decent shots along the way and I remembered reading Yelpers' reviews about a doughnut shop. That was our destination and we eventually found it. 

Yes, Voodoo Doughnuts. I was surprised at the fact that it was only a small waiting area and a huge kitchen in back with no available seating. The line was long, reaffirming their popularity and tasty product. I got the doughnut for which the shop is named and there was something so sweet and satisfying about eating something so sinful in the shape of a person. The pretzel it came with was well used in my case. I had a blast stabbing its little icing heart and watching the raspberry goo spill out. The experience of eating a doughnut here is unique and entertaining. My guy even said longingly (before my little doughnut person was entirely consumed), ""I have this strange urge to bite off his other arm."" To which I responded, ""That's the first thing I went for!""

In all honesty though, these doughnuts are fun and delicious; an experience like no other I've had before.

As we turned the corner to get to the store, there was line of about 10 or so people, and the line was outside the donut shop.  We waited no more than 10 mins until we actually got into the shop, and waited about another 5 mins.  Once I stepped into the place, the smell of sugar filled my lungs, and my eyes wandered all around the teeny shop, first looking at the kitchen as the workers busily bake, and up to the hand-written list of donuts, and to crazy-looking random artwork on the walls, and lastly to an ATM machine (since they don't accept cards for payments) that obviously looked like it had been completely tattooed with sharpie.  

I wanted to try all the donuts, but because that would put me at risk for diabetes in the future, I figured 1 donut would be good enough.  We ended up buying 6: Two bacon donuts, 1 fruitloop, an oreo donut, and oreo donut with peanut butter (aka 'Old Dirty Bastard'), and one that had some sort of white filling in it.  All were delicious, but my favorite was the Old Dirty Bastard, and then the Bacon donut.  The bacon might not look so great on the donut, but it definitely gives a smoky taste to it, which was not bad at all!

I love donuts, Voodoo makes the tastiest chocolate raised donuts in town. That's enough for a five star rating. 

Never go on weekends because it's filled with tourists and they order slow. Waiting in line for a donut on a drunken Friday or Saturday night must be done at least once. 

I'm not a fan of the crazier options. The toppings on the cereal and oreo covered ones sometimes taste stale to me, but the chocolate raised donuts are the very best in town. 

The donut is light and fluffy like a cloud. They cover it in chocolate. There's just enough room to safely hold the donut. One is enough, but you'll want a second one.",2017-06-14 00:25:59

Voodoo has a hip local flair to their restaurant.  Their tagline is ""The Magic is in the Hole"".  You can get doughnuts topped with Cereals, filled doughnuts, or their signature voodoo doughnut.  It was blazing hot, and we were not terribly hungry, so my wife and I split 3 between us.  The classic Voodoo Doughnut is really good.  The glaze and raspberry filling are good while the doughnut itself remains light and fluffy.  I have to show off a little bit by saying I got a free doughnut for wearing a Bowie shirt.
The downside to a local institution like Voodoo Doughnut is there will always be a line.  Be prepared to wait.  Also, they are cash-only.",2015-08-14 13:42:33

Their menu items include ""cock rings"" for god sake... stop taking yourself and this place too seriously. 

In short, Voodoo Doughnut is a high-energy, 24/7 machine of sugary awesomeness. The music is loud, the staff can be bitchy, and the atmosphere is awesome. Yes, there are homeless folks outside (it's their city too), and they are non-threatening, and will strike up polite conversation. 

The line was to the door, but very fast (thanks to aforementioned aggressive staff). I had the Ol' Dirty Bastard. I'm not 100% sure of all the ingredients, but my best guess would be unicorn sweat, laughter of children, and Oreos. The first bite nearly sent me in to sugar shock. By the third bite, I had full blown Diabetes. Perfect. It was cold and rainy outside, and we stood in the middle of the shop eating our doughnuts, senselessly bumping into people, listening to the music, and watching what seems like production chaos to the untrained eye, but is really a well-oiled machine of happiness. 

It's not that my standards are lower than some of the other petty reviews. To the contrary, they likely much higher, but I get what's going on here. Like me, you may be skeptical because of the insane amount of press Voodoo Doughnut has received. In this case though, it's completely warranted, and the doughnuts live up to the reputation. I have officially converted to Voodoo.",2016-01-23 04:31:47

Boy, was the wait worth it.  I ordered the bacon maple bar while my girlfriend ordered the dirt donut, and we both thoroughly enjoyed our choices.

I'm not a big fan of donuts, but I was sure as h*#%ll going to buy a box to take home to my family. I spent like $40 in uber back and forth to my hotel in order to go here. Was it worth it? Most definitely! It's all about the experience! This is one of THE most famous donut shops in the U.S., if not the world! I can cross this off my bucket list now!

It is a smaller place than I thought and the line was so long, that I barely had a chance to enjoy the scenery. You have to come in and basically get out as soon as you're done with your purchase to make room for others. It was dimly lit, but it added to that whole ""Voodoo"" vibe. 

They don't accept anything but cash, so I unfortunately, had to pay $3 to use the ATM and zip back in line, so be prepared my Yelp friends! If you don't want to have to get out of line and don't have anyone to save your spot, carry cash! In a world of technology and cards to pay the bills in order to save paper, cash is still needed here, so after that little bump in the road, I finally got my big a$&% box of donuts plus some extras for a little over $40 and after some lugging around and smudging the voodoo donut faces (their fates were sealed once I bought them anyways, luckily I took cute pics of them beforehand), they were quickly devoured by the fam bam. 

They were day or so old donuts by the time I went home, so if you're a donut aficionado, definitely enjoy yours on the spot. If you don't mind day old donuts, I was told that u can buy a bucket-full for only $5! I might have to do that next time so my donuts can be better protected instead of having a smushed box. That, and save myself like $30... But again, the experience was worth it, all so I can say that I've been to Voodoo.",2016-03-23 19:53:47

Quick Disclaimer: This is my first 5 star; however, it is not because it's the first place to impress me. I have a backlog of hundreds of eateries, and several of them are 5 star...I just happened to be in front of my computer while trying these out.

I'm not a donut lover. My brother in law is, but I'm not. Krispy Kremes are great, but I also think Dunkin Donuts isn't too far behind. That should tell you how uncivilized my donut tastes are. But, despite the disclaimer, I can assure you, I have never had better donuts than these!

First is the Bacon Maple, their signature. When I heard about it, I wasn't as disgusted as most people get. Think about it, how many times have you gone to IHOP and had pancakes or french toast or something and took a bite of pancake and ate bacon at the same time? It happens often! How often has your syrup bled onto the bacon? I bet just as much. This taste really isn't a foreign concept guys; however, kudos to Voodoo for actually putting it in donut form (which is a foreign concept). The maple frosting in and of itself might have been too sweet, had it been by itself, but the salty bacon really does the job to, not even it, but compliment it. And it's not a gentle compliment either, it's not yin and yang, it's a Big Bang of flavors to really show you the impressive distance between salty and sweet.

Next, to settle down a little, the weak link of the show, the Cap'n Crunch (I think it's called O Captain my Captain or something). It's a white frosting with Crunch Berries cereal topped on it. My Crunch Berries have definitely been out too long, because they're not that crunchy anymore. This donut was pretty unimpressive. The taste of the Crunch Berries really outweigh any other flavor, whether there was supposed to be any flavor in the dough or the frosting. The frosting merely adds more sugar to the already sweet Cap'n Crunch. I didn't not like it because it was too sweet, I didn't like it because (not-so-crunchy factor aside) it just tasted like Crunch Berries.

Now, back to the pre-grand finale...The NO NAME donut. What made this stand out was the peanut butter. Don't think I've ever heard of anyone putting peanut butter on a donut before. Chocolate frosting, rice krispies, and a drizzle of peanut butter. Since it's a drizzle, you don' t expect too much PB taste, but man oh man, believe it or not, it's the first thing to hit you! You take a bite and you hear your teeth crunching the Rice Krispies, and you feel your teeth sliding through a good 1/2 centimeter of chocolate frosting! You go numb for a fraction of a second in anxious expectation waiting to see what you're gonna taste, and like the initial bang of a firecracker, you get the peanut butter. Then just like how you see the BOOM before you hear it, you're suddenly smacked with the super intense chocolate flavor. Right ; however, the flavor rushes in all directions sort of giving you an outline of how big this flavor is gonna be, and then right after, it colors in between the lines as the chocolate sweetness just fills everything in between. It's so sweet it hurts your teeth! After it's over, as dessert (lol), you can lick your lips and you get a quick light encore of Peanut Butter.

And last but not least, the grand finale. The mega Apple Fritter. This is my benchmark. Every donut shop I goto, I make sure to get one of these. First, the thing's huge. The diameter is about 1 1/3 iPhones (the long way....it's my only measurement right now). It's at least 1.5-2 inches thick. It's heavy, and it's goodness through and through: 
1) Coating - The sugar coating around it is thick, as it should be, and when hard, should make a nice knocking sound on the table. You should be able to tap it with your fingernail...check!
2) Crisp - The outer layer of this thing, since it is deep fried after all,  needs to have a slight crisp. Plus, once you're chewing it, it needs to crunch in all the places where you're getting the coating....Check
3) Flavor - It has to have the perfect mix of buttery inside with the sweet coating on the outside, and also a hint of apple cinnamon. 
4) Donut Air - All the sweet donut goodness makes the air around it smell like heaven. When you cook a donut like this, you trap air inside (I'm pretending like I know what I'm talking about). When you chew a decent size portion of this, you should be able to taste and almost swallow donut air. If you don't know what I'm talking about, oh well. 

In the end, if you don't have a sweet tooth, this may not be the place. If you don't ever like supersweet food, don't ever come here. If you have the occasional urge to gorge on decadent sugar...this is it!

Well, I'm about to explode now.",2010-02-09 07:05:25

They are both awesome.  The voodoo doughnut is a little guy with raspberry blood filling.  He is tasty and cute.  It is kind of like eating bento, because you are too busy staring at it and wondering at how cute it is that you can forget to put it in your mouth.  Unlike bento, you will get chocolate on your fingers.

 The maple bacon doughnut is just the best doughnut flavor ever.  I know people that are vegan except for the maple bacon doughnut at Voodoo.  The maple bacon doughnut is an excellent reason to break your vegan vows - it is just that delicious.  

If, like me, you ever order bacon with waffles or French toast or pancakes or what have you, then dunk your bacon in the syrup before eating it - Voodoo has turned that into a doughnut.  And it is wonderful. This doughnut is the reason I have not eaten anything else at Voodoo.

I love them, and I love the original location even more since the remodel.  They're also pretty close to the Max line, so I don't even have to drive downtown to indulge! 

I disagree with reviewers that say the doughuts aren't quality and people are only into it for the hype.  Every doughnut that I've had there was amazing -  I love the unique varieties and the fact that the doughuts are always fluffy and moist.  I've never had a dry or a stale doughnut and I wouldn't waste a whole days worth of calories on crap junk food - this is the real deal.  I love the cereal-type varieties: the Triple Chocolate Penetration is my fave (chocolate doughnut with chocolate icing topped with coco puffs!).  The Voodoo Doll is also a must try (I could eat the filling by the bucket full), as is the Cock and Balls - its enormous, just as it should be!  As far as doughnut shops go, this place is a bit on the pricier side, but its worth it for me.

I've always had to wait in line no matter which location I go to, which day of the week, or time of day. I guess I've had bad luck.  I'm jealous of those that have been able to walk right in.  

News you can use: 1. Be prepared to wait the longest on weekends, especially during the months that Saturday Market is happening (and remember its Saturday and Sunday), since its just about a block away and the tourists come a runnin'!  2. The menu at the register doesn't describe each doughnut - so either decide BEFORE you get there by looking at the menu on their website, or bring your smartphone with you so you can pull up the menu while you're waiting in line.  You'll thank me.",2011-10-17 18:45:19

I discovered the secret: everyone hating on it & saying its ""too sweet""--you ordered wrong. Here's the deal. If you don't want a donut that's ""too sweet"", maybe don't opt for the one covered in fruity pebbles and captain crunch and Oreo crumbs and drenched in icing. That is some people's thing (a very small minority, I imagine) but props to this company for being so innovative & the only ones to get weird with it. Judge this place based on the staples: like a maple bar, or a blueberry cake donut. Not gonna lie, voodoo wasn't even on my list bc all the reviews made it seem like it was too over the top and experimental...but they have normal donuts too and OH MY GOSH DO THEY DO THEM WELL. Hands down the BEST maple bar I've ever had. The donut was perfectly made, soft and doughy with a sliiiight crunch, and the icing was unreal. Maple is usually too sweet for me after a couple bites, but not this one--the consistency was unreal. I've never loved icing on a donut this much. Blueberry cake was reeeeally good too. If you're going, but don't think you would like a donut covered in sugar cereal, you probably won't and probably shouldn't order it.

The donuts are in a show case that spins like a high end jewelry show case....but better 'cause these rings can be eaten (or put on the finger). 

Each donut is uniquely decorated. It's all your favorite junk foods and things in your pantry on a donut.

I don't really like doughnuts. I don't know why and people generally think I'm nuts, but I just don't really like them. I have more of a ""salty tooth"" than a sweet one I guess. 

But there I was, at around 1am in Portland, pretty drunk after a session at Kells (aka the best Irish pub in North America I'm sure) and someone suggested Voodoo doughnut and a ""cock and balls"" doughnut. This I had to see.... We miraculously managed to find our way on foot and came upon the aforementioned doughnut-erie with people spilling out the door. When I approached the counter, what did I find? Lo and behold, there was a doughnut - a maple bar - draped with a slab of bacon. Bacon! Every slightly drunken neuron in my brain drooled a little and so did my mouth. Seriously. I dribbled spit on the front of my shirt. But anyway, the bacon-licious maple bar doughnut was YUMMY!

We came in the middle of the afternoon so naturally we had a lengthy wait (as this now seems to be one of the biggest tourist draws in Portland).  The line, for all of its scary, scary length did move relatively quickly, so that was good.  

When we finally reached the front of the line, we ordered quickly and with purpose (we had been waiting for this and had educated ourselves about our choices appropriately ahead of time), and filled up a box of doughnuts to sample.  The doughnuts we tried that day included: 

Bacon Maple Bar
Memphis Mafia
Dirt Doughnut 
Mango Tango
Miami Vice Berry
Dirty Snowball
Old Dirty Bastard
Voodoo Doughnut

These doughnuts totally lived up to our expectations and were absolutely worth the wait (at least to have our little doughnut fest once).  Look, if there are people who can find much better doughnuts (as some reviews suggest), then I surely envy them, because these are quality doughnuts.  They are sweet, but not the overpowering sweet of something like a Krispy Kreme.  They have good texture and consistency and good flavors.  The whimsical names and toppings adds an extra element of fun that is lacking from most other doughnuts.  We were very happy with our sampling right up until we entered a sugar overload that lasted well into the next day (evidently there can be too much of a good thing).  

I would definitely recommend checking it out and encourage them to open a store in the Bay Area (so we can get some more!).

The funkiest ones I grabbed would have to be the ""cereal donuts""!  I mean, c'mon now!  One of these donuts had some Cap'n Crunch Berries all up in here!!!  Then there's the Fruit Loops one, too!

At first glance, it quickly becomes apparent that this is NO ordinary donut shop!-Aside from the unusually charming name, it appears somewhat like any old donut shop, but that is where the regularities cease! 

My cashier, is apparently a former HOMELESS person, who then chose to literally SPECKLE his face with homemade blue pen tattoos, but again, I try not to judge, and proceed to give him my order...which sounds something like "" Yeah, Um 'hi', I've never been here before, so I guess I will get a PINK one, that BLUE one, 2 Maple Logs, a ""Cock N Balls"", an Old Fashioned and The Oreo Cookie one"". and with a mouthful of syllables...I was DONE! That was probably the start of Diabetes as well! 

The place is INCREDIBLY popular, my friends on FaceBook all recommended I go there, so of course, like a mule...I DID!

They are open 24 hours a day (Thanks YELP for clarifying that!) and have 4 locations.

The Portland Creme was ok for me, just tasted like a regular cream doughnut. The staff members were great at crowd controlling the line when it was out the door, and they gave great recommendations. I love the decor inside the shop. Its really small but there is outdoor seating with lots of room to eat.  Prices were cheap about $2 a doughnut (Cash Only!).

I go to Voodoo probably once a week downtown, and once a week to their eastside location. 

If your not from Portland you'll be shell shocked when you go to the downtown location. It's great seeing the tourists but here's some advice.

Just get a VooDoo Dozen because you can then try 12-13 of their donuts instead of taking foreverrr to figure out what you want!

I love the TexAss but my new favorite thing is to get the ""tip donut"" (whatever they made up) at their eastside location. If you want to sit down, go to that one. If you want a Portland exp., go downtown. I think the Portland Walking Tours even goes there.

Voodoo Doll- ours looked extremely sad, probably because there was a pretzel stabbed into him. Poor voodoo :( He was yummy though MUAHAHA!

Portland Cream- filled with Bavarian cream. It was ok but I'm not big of cream filled doughnuts.

Grape Ape- tasted very grape-y. 

Dirt Doughnut- tasted like cookies and cream, yum! :)

Maple Blazer Blunt- didn't taste as good as it looked but it was fun to play with before eating.

Marshall Matters- m&m's on a doughnut? Yes please!

Old Dirty Bastard- I'm not a big fan of peanut butter so I only thought it was ok but the others loved it.

Miami Vice Berry- it was only ok.

No Name- I had a bite without peanut butter and I liked the rice krispies and chocolate flavors together

Apple Jack- I heard it was a one day only thing. It was maple and apple jacks. It was pretty good, minus the fact that the apple jacks were stale because we waited a few hours before eating this one (that was dumb of us lol).

We ordered a dozen and it took us about 4 days to eat them all.  My favorites are the Portland Cream (thick, tasty doughnut with real yellow cream filling, semi-sweet chocolate icing, and two simple little eyes staring back at me) and the Bacon Maple (thick slices of bacon atop a maple bar - I've had bacon maple donuts before, but Voodoo has perfected the taste combination, balancing salty and sweet at just the right levels).  I appreciate the inventiveness of the Captain My Captain and the Loop, but I'm not a fan of commercial cereal on top of a donut, so I let my family scarf those down.

Got a half a dozen and probably going to get more.
Favorites:
* Grape ape: This tastes like a grape laffy taffy exploded over the top of your donut. Get it.  
* Voodoo Bubble: Cream tastes like a delicious piece of bubblegum. It always bothered me that I like those little double bubble gums but could never swallow. This fulfills my childhood itch.

Okay on:
* Old dirty bastard: Oreos with caramel topping. Pretty good. Weird texture.
* Voodoo doll: Okay I got it because it was cute. It's an alright donut. Standard raspberry filled donut with chocolate glazing. Just cool looking.
* Maple bacon: Was good amount of salty-sweet and I can see how someone would like it... but I don't like bacon very much. Just wanted to try it. 

Didn't like:
* Fruit loops: Ugh. The fruit loops were stale and I didn't like the texture of the two together. Stale fruit loops suck. Threw this donut away. 

Oh and the line is hilariously long. There's a line that wraps around... and then there's another extra thing for the spillover line to wrap around (more tightly) four times or so.

He yelled out to me as we walked into VooDoo, ""Good luck getting your donut!"" I didn't quite get that.
We stood in line for 15 minutes, while my daughter drooled over the case and made plans for an orange donut with sparkly sprinkles. We get up to the front, she orders her donut. As it is being handed to her, I ask in panic if they take cards. The attendant practically ripped the plate from my crushed little girls hands, and replied ""no"". We left in tears and hit Stumptown.
Flash forward to two weeks later. My daughter has been talking non-stop about that donut. I grab some cash, and both kids. I drop my daughter off at ballet and promise her she will have her donut today (big mistake). My son and I run to VooDoo real quick for the donuts. Apparently VooDoo had been featured on Food Network that week and the line was around the block! There was no way we would be able to get back for the end of my daughers class and have donuts in hand. Another day with crushed kids.

Saw them on TV, read about them in magazines, heard from friends, heard about it from enemies....
So I had to try them out while working in Portland for the week.

The doughnut chain that purposely misspells doughnut and implies you should ""dunk"" your doughnuts has always been my standard of a raised doughnut...until now.

Voodoo has both cake and raised.

The raised is superior in my opinion. They are denser than my old standard. This is a huge plus to me. If I am going to waste my caloric intake on a doughnut, I want it to be worth it.

Bottom line.... they meet the hype!

The staff's pretty cool themselves, and when I don't have a giant line hounding me from behind, I try to chat 'em up a bit while enjoying my deep fried goodness.

I figured I needed to check the box.  First of all, the doughnuts are complete eye candy.  For anybody impressed by funky designs and bold colors, they are a feast for the eyes.  There are so many to choose from as well, and it can be overwhelming, especially if you're hoping for a perfect match.  I settled on a cake doughnut covered with white icing, topped by crushed Oreos.  All I have to see it was heaven at first bite.  I couldn't believe it.  Before I could exhale, I was nearly finished.  I just couldn't help myself.  I went back another time with an out-of-town guest that was recently visiting.  I made myself try something entirely different.  It was a marshmallow-creme filled doughnut, topped with a chocolate frosting.  Again, I thought I died and went to Nirvana.  Every bite, every morsel was perfect.  I will go there again and again, proud Portlander that I am.  Now, if you are not the kind of person that likes your desserts incredibly sweet, this is not the place for you.

People travel far and wide to try their gourmet offerings. I got a Bacon Maple Bar. It is every bit as delicious as it sounds. Certainly a runner for best doughnut in history. 

My companion for the night recommended I take a 6-pack with me on my travels. I'd get to enjoy the iconic pink take-home box they put them in, and I'd have a great conversation piece on the train trip. Each doughnut was unique and delicious.

The Voodoo Doll - a doll-shaped, raspberry jelly-filled doughnut, with chocolate frosting and a pretzel stick in it's heart.

Diablos Rex - a chocolate doughnut, chocolate frosting, filled with chocolate chips, and sprinkled with a vanilla frosting pentagram and red sprinkles. Certainly the most formidably chocolate creation known to man.

Dirt Doughnut - this one was covered in vanilla frosting and lots of Oreo chunks. 

Bacon Maple Bar - I had to get another, it was like eating the best breakfast in the world.

Miami Vice - a doughnut with vanilla frosting, half-covered in blue raspberry powder and half-covered in pink sprinkles. 

Old Dirty Bastard - a doughnut with chocolate frosting, topped with Oreo chunks and peanut butter drizzle. Possibly my second favorite.

Those were my six, and I enjoyed them all (unfortunately) on my train ride through the country. I need to lay off the sugar now. Your weakness for sweets will surrender completely to the large variety of doughnuts they have on stock at any given time. You should check this place out if you're ever in the area.

Each donut is priced slightly differently, but the 12 we ordered came out to just over $18. To be honest, most of the donuts were pretty basic, but the cleverness and quirkiness of the place and the donuts names really made for a fun experience. My personal favorite was the Marshall Mathers donut, which was a vanilla donut with tons of miniature M&M's on it [a reference to the rapper Eminem]. I also really liked both the name and the amazing flavor of the Arnold Palmer, which may be the best fruity donut I've ever had. It was tarty and sweet and chunky and delicious.

Look, this is an obvious landmark in the Pacific Northwest, so if you're anywhere in the vicinity my advice to you is this: buck up and wait in the 30-40 minute line (there's no way around it, not even during the 24-hours that the shop is open).

I went down to Portland For only these doughnuts.   Boy was it worth it. The doughnut Balls are cheap and regular amazing doughnut is a Dollar and 95 cents but that may change when u read this review . Omg- I bite into the Mango tango Doughnut and it made it all worth it. A fruit filling that tasted like I was biting into a mango and a piece of heaven . omg.  I bought 3 dozen doughnuts to bring home to my family and friends . I bought every none cream or cereal doughnut possible. They were all amazing from the grape ape to the bacon maple bar . The legendary Bacon bar has 2  whole strips of bacon on it.. I wish Yelp would let me post pics of the doughnuts . The doughnut are also creative. you wont find a more creative doughnut  shop m  in the USA.  They are better then top pot or krispy kreme ect. Just promise me one thing after Reading this review you will go to voodoo doughnuts and you will get a doughnut. you got to try the voodoo doughnuts,2013-09-29 13:34:57

Don't let the long lines dissuade you from waiting.  They move pretty quick and are worth it.  I've waited in lines there several times and have never waited for more than 15 minutes.  And there's plenty to look at while you are waiting, so the time flies by pretty fast.  Don't let anyone tell you that you will wait for an hour.

Yes, it seems silly to stand in that massive line for a doughnut, but oh boy is it tasty.  

I got two doughnuts, one to eat immediately and one to save until after dinner.  The Portland Cream was absolutely delicious.  The doughnut itself was perfectly fluffy, as all yeast raised doughnuts should be (though often fail to be) and delicious.  The filling wasn't painfully sweet or overly thick as some doughnut shops interpret the word ""cream"" as ""leftover frosting.""  

The next one I got was called no-name, which was peanut butter, chocolate frosting, and rice krispies.  Deeeelicious!  I am a sucker for all things peanut butter so it's not a surprise I loved this, but the combination of chocolate and peanut butter with neither overshadowing the other in combination with the varied textures of the light doughnut and the crispy cereal, it was great.

Plus, the doughnuts are a lot cheaper than other places would offer for such ""gourmet"" treats, and come on, it IS a portland landmark.  It's for tourism! Calories don't count for tourism, right?",2013-08-10 18:22:21

The line outside went back and forth once, and we waited about 20-30 minutes. This is a Saturday morning so I would think that's bad, but some locals tell me it can get up to 90 minutes in summer months. 

When we got inside, I can see why the line was long. The employees work very quickly but between the quirky decor, and the many doughnut choices (and a photo booth we didn't go to) it's hard to move along quickly. They have the classics, some specialty doughnuts, vegan doughnuts, and more. 

The doughnuts were actually pretty tasty. I don't know if I'd typically wait 30 minutes for any doughnuts, but if you love doughnuts you won't be disappointed. Part of the experience was waiting, and knowing you're hitting a ""must try"" spot, so all in all it was good. My favorite was the Portland Cream (chocolate covered filled doughnut). My husband got a cake doughnut with chocolate topping and it was really soft and moist. We also got the obligatory voodoo doll, a special guava colada, a buttermilk bar, and a classic glazed doughnut. All we're very tasty, but the voodoo doll was more for looks.

One of the best doughnuts I have ever eaten!! I knew I was in for a treat when I took that first bite and the doughnut was so soft and fresh.

It kind of looks like a Girl Scout cookie and was actually my favorite of the two. 

The pink boxes are fun. The employees are friendly. And the line really doesn't take that long. I heard a story that they started by selling donuts with a shot of Benadryl in the middle, a ""voodoo"" spell, if you will.

Gotta make this the last stop of every trip to PDX before heading home!

Voodoo's employees are the only thing that you can't be sure of.
I've had some employees that are rude when I'm choosing donuts (when i'm not super slow and it's 5 AM and there's no one waiting behind us) and then I've had super friendly ones that are patient when you take 2.5 seconds to chose the last of your dozen out of a huge variety.

The portland cream is my favorite! They use fresh custard and it makes a difference.
But anything here is really good.
The pothole was slightly too sweet for me, but if you share it i'm sure i'll be good.
It's real cereal toppings so you'll want to eat it ASAP.

They're donuts, they're good, and they have buttons!

Now, when Blue Star gets brought up...
Blue Star donuts are good. They offer unique and experimental flavors and combinations that Voodoo doesn't, but Voodoo is very novel and tasty. I'd much rather have a blue star donut one or twice in a trip to Portland, but ALWAYS bring back voodoo for friends and family.

I've known about Voodoo for a while (saw it on The Amazing Race, and some food shows), but regretfully never made it there....until now.  

Walking up to Voodoo, I knew I was in for something special seeing  there was a line almost around the corner.  I quickly got in line.  I chatted to a few other patrons.  There was a Seattle couple who were newbies like me, but who were excited to have a Voodoo experience.  There was the ""regular"" couple who goes all the time, and still go even after moving 30-min further away.  

While waiting in line, we'd see people come out w/ pink boxes and big grins.  ""Don't open that box, unless you want to start losing donuts!"" said a person in line to a group of people walking out w/ a Pink Box.

All in all, the wait was about 30min.  Inside, there's a small area where one can read the menu and see what's in the rotating donut display.  Oh, it should be noted they don't take credit cards.  They do have an ATM in this room though.  

Back to the donuts---decisions, decisions, decisions!  They all looked good.  I ultimately went for the Voodoo Dozen.  It's a dozen donuts they pick out for you & its all for a very reasonable price.

Now I had seen some crazy donuts, and the one which was craziest to me was the maple bar with some bacon on it----YES, bacon!!  I had to get one.  So, since it wasn't included in my Voodoo dozen, I ordered one extra.  I also ordered a couple of the Voodoo doll donuts as well.  With that I was set (my co-workers were in for some treats---I'm waaay too nice!).

As for the Bacon Maple Bar....it was actually really good!  The maple icing was evil (i.e. really good!), and the mix of the icing with the salty bacon-y goodness....well, it's something I know Homer Simpson would have loved.  If it's good enough for Homer, it's good enough for me (well, in moderation).

First, it's cheaper than cupcakes.  With most options ranging between $1.25-$2.50, Voodoo is half the price of Sprinkles and Georgetown Cupcakes.  Second, it offers the opportunity for more complex toppings and flavors.  Cupcakeries are too conservative to offer a maple bacon cupcake?  Granted, should someone bake it, I shall eat that too.  Third, donuts offers a more balanced treat than cupcakes.  The unsweetened fried dough is a foil to its sugary toppings unlike the unadulterated sugar-on-sugar combination of cupcakes.

Tourist Trap or not, Voodoo Doughnut is one place you shouldn't miss.  Plus, it's open 24 hours so you can beat the crowds by coming in at 5am.  [Original Visit: December 18, 2010]

I was a little unenthusiastic about waiting in line for nearly an hour (it was pride weekend so I think under normal conditions the wait wouldn't be so long), but my travel companions were adament about getting some voodoo doughnuts.   These doughnuts were well worth the wait, not just for the taste, but for the experience as well.  This is a gothic, bad ass doughnut shop.   We got a dozen doughnuts so we could sample many kinds.  Highlights were:

Bacon maple bar - Better than I expected it to be.  High quality, thick cut bacon, good dough, great maple flavor.
Dirty Ole' Bastard - Peanut butter is one of my favorite foods, so I am a little bias towards this one.  There's Oreos on this pastry as well as peanut butter.  Oreos didn't add a ton of flavor, but did add great crunch to the peanut buttery taste.
Apple Fritter - A giant doughnut, fed about three people.  We got one of a fresh batch of these so it was warm and still slightly gooey.
Buttermilk bar - This is a simple doughnut, but buttermilk and old fashions are my favorite doughnuts.  This one didn't disappoint.

The dough for all these doughnuts was what really made them outstanding.  Anyone can slap some frosting or glaze on a pastry and make it sugary and sweet, but the chewy, fluffy consistancy of the dough made these doughnuts stand out.

While standing in line for about 30 minutes to get a hold of these scrumptous sounding donuts with quite possibly ever verison of Portland's chain smoking emo/hipster lined up along with us, Misty managed to procure a screwdriver from a local bike guy (complete with roiling B.O.) to change her expired CA plates out for her new Washington ones. Legal and composed, we invited the bicyclist to cut in line with us and offered to buy him donuts. 

Decor: Voodoo skulls, giant donuts, Disneyland-esque chandaliers and pink walls...I was seriously ready for the Mad Hatter to jump out and serving tea. 

Donuts: THEY WERE OUT OF THE VOODOO MAN. :( I'm very sad, as this one of the main appeals of the place. I was looking forward to jabbing him with toothpicks!

The Grape Ape doesn't melt well, but otherwise delish, Dirty Snowball was f* amazing even though I hate coconut usually the peanut butter gave it an awesome edge. Butterfingering...well it had Butterfingers crumbled on top with a perk of minus the sticky teeth syndrome, and I can't say I have ever had issues consuming a Butterfinger. Vegan donuts tasted like banana bread, probably as they are trying to make up for the texture with lack of diary? Don't get me wrong, they're really good, just not something I'd eat all the time. 

Staff & Service: Not too amazing...the girl was nice enough who served us, the usual apathetic college undergrad/grad, but she did make some amazing suggestions (however, all lacking excitement or pizazz, just simply grabbed donut and threw in box).

I went to the original location and since it was a Monday it really wasn't that cray. I was overwhelmed with my options really wanting one of each. I settled on 6 donuts-- hey that's me holding back!

We got outside and I was able to get a mocha from the coffee stand across the way.

The Voodoo doll was yummy with the chocolate frosting and raspberry filling. It was my favorite of all the donuts and I was very surprised!

Anyway, I really can't wait to go back and try some more! I would willingly travel long distances for food and this will be one of those places.

There was a manageable line outside the original location which has been the subject of many food shows and documentaries so we joined it and started people watching. Every size, shape and color wanted to partake in what has been described as an euphoric journey into the doughnut world and I don't blame them one bit! Of course I looked like I belonged in the line with my pot belly and under-dressed attire for the weather (shorts and t-shirt). While waiting we were talked up by one of the Voodoo Doughnut denizens explaining some of their creations, offering up suggestions and revealing what's really inside the c&b doughnut (can't say what c&b stands for because I might violate some terms or something, look it up!). I'd have to say with all those distracting factors in play, it seemed like the wait was nothing at all.

Finally we whipped our way inside the small doughnut shop only to be greeted by pink walls, a few chandeliers and decor that seemed to belong in a museum of the macabre. Yes it was odd but I was seeing much much more behind the counter on countless rolling racks. I was finally called up to the counter and reluctantly gave my order because I wanted them all but didn't want to look like a complete sow! I asked for a ""Grape Ape"", ""Arnold Palmer"" and a few t-shirts because I was not about to bring a dozen doughnuts on a plane as I was requested to do by family.

The doughnuts were amazing in their own special ways. First off I sunk my teeth into the Grape Ape, it was like grape soda was mixed into the frosting without the bubbles while grape powder and grape sprinkles adorned the top. It was literally one of the best doughnuts I'd ever tasted! I should've waited a while to partake in the Arnold Palmer but my inner and outer fat kid said NO WAY!

A 24-hr boutiquey donut shop? YES PLZ.

My twin told me about this place 'cus it was featured on the Food Network, so on my last visit back to my Alma Mater I had to stop by and see what all the buzz was about-- fit perfectly into my sched considering its 24-hrness. Loves it.

My bff Bob and I decided to try a few, Bubble Gum, Cereal, and Plain Cinnamon and sugar are the ones I tasted, he tasted more. The Bubble Gum was pink-right up my alley, and really tasted like bubble yubble or whatever they include in the hole of the donut (see pics), the   cereal woulda been better if it was JUST Cap'n Crunch and not those weird pebble things, and the C&S was devine.

Only downfall was they only take cash, which I NEVER have on me- so thanks Bob!

bacon and maple doughnut was awesome. i loved the salty flavor and crunch of the bacon (fried HARD) with the texture of the ultra sweet maple doughnut. the bread itself is somewhat more doughy than light and melty like krispy kreme, but significantly lighter than old-school doughnut shops. it'd probably be better if the bacon was spread throughout the whole doughnut, but that's just being nitpicky. 

the place is small and whimsical, with an mel n alice type of cake curio highlighting the different kinds of doughnuts they offer. they take cash only and parking is a cinch. be sure to tip since portland doesn't have sales tax anyways. please don't be an asshole when this place offers such great treats for your stummy!

the SO got a chocolate doughnut and didn't feel like explaining the pros and cons of it. BUT, she did finish the whole damn thing in less than 2 minutes so it must've been good. plus, she shakes her legs and bounces in her seat when she eats something good (kinda like a baby) and this trip was no exception.

If you're visiting from out of town, you should definitely put it on your list of places to try.  The quality is excellent, and it's as fun an experience as a trip to a doughnut shop is likely to be.  

I do have to admit, if I'm honest, that I don't quite see why the place has such a draw from around the world, but it does.  When I first moved here in 1996, my friends all said, ""OHMYGOD, WE HAVE TO GO TO VOODOO DOUGHNUTS.""   So we went, and it was delicious, but tiny--just a few feet across--and then we kind of sat there with our doughnuts saying, ""What do we do?""   That has changed since then.

They remodeled and expanded a few years back, and that improved the place dramatically.  It's now a major attraction, and rightly so.  They have a great selection of doughnuts--everything from standard government-issue varieties to phalluses (you've been warned) and cereal-covered concoctions--so you'll have no difficulty finding something that's to your liking.  

Worth mentioning to tourists is that that bit of downtown can be a bit seedy late at night.  Not bad, necessarily, but it's definitely noticeable, and you should be prepared for that.  And have fun.",2013-10-08 20:42:31

Granted, the line is very long. But if you don't mind waiting a bit (and it really is only a bit, since they have three cashiers at a time cycling through the line), then the pay off is rewarding. Once inside, you see an expansive menu of donuts, from something as simple as a ""maple bar"" to more ""out there"" varieties like the ""gay bar"" and ""giant peach,"" both of which we sampled, as well as the ""voodoo doll"" that they are famous for--a chocolate glazed, ghost-shaped donut with a jelly center that is being stabbed by a pretzel stake. Awesome. Every donut listed shares space on rotating pedestals where they are showcased to the line, and from there you can see how different and complex some varieties are. Because the menu is so developed, these really help to narrow the options down. It also led me to choose the ""Homer Simpson,"" a simple strawberry-frosted with sprinkles, a nostalgic novelty with great icing that tasted like Dunkin Donuts if they were still independently owned.

We only waited about 15 minutes or so and ordered smoothly, getting a really cute pink box with their logo and five delicious donuts inside. They all tasted fresh, taken from the array of racks in the back of the store, where employees were working on them behind the scenes.

We got lucky cause ours was filled with: the Grape Ape (vanilla with grape powder on top), Triple Chocolate Penetration (chocolate cake donut, chocolate frosting entrenched with coco puffs), TANG (sprinkled with the magical orange stuff), maple bars galore, and the Fruit Loops one.

We had the chocolate voodoo man, dirty bastard, blueberry, and butterfinger donut. They were all so delicious but as a huge fan of peanut butter and Oreos, the dirty bastard stole the show.

I also had the Old Dirty Bastard which was a doughnut with chocolate frosting, Oreo's with peanut butter drizzled on top and that was just as good as the maple bacon. The Oreo cookies were crunchy and the peanut butter atop sets that doughnut off. I snuck in a few bites of my bf's Captain my Crunch doughnut and again, another amazing concoction. Its a doughnut with a white glaze, covered in Captain Crunch Cereal. I had a plain maple doughnut as well which was made perfectly. I have only had a few doughnuts off their large menu and I have no complaints about any of them so I can only imagine how great the other's are.

I ordered the Bacon Maple Bar and the Chocolate Glaze donut, but the latter was sold out so I could only enjoy my bacon maple bar, which was delicious.

As I walked out of there with my friend we both agreed that, that place was kinda weird. We also both agreed that if we had to listen to that music all day we would go crazy.

The downtown location is small and parking is always hard to come by, but if you park in Chinatown and are willing to walk a couple blocks to get there then it's no biggie.

The only downside to voodoo is probably the staff. I've never gotten a friendly vibe from any of them, which is probably just because they are always so incredibly busy in there.

To showcase some of their more interesting doughnuts, all of which I have tried and loved:

Old Dirty Bastard - a raised doughnut with chocolate topping, crushed oreos and peanut butter drizzle

Bacon Maple Bar - yes... it's real bacon. Your standard maple bar with two lovely, crispy and fresh strips of bacon on top. Get over the weird and get with the bacon... this is amazing

Cock n Balls - this is your basic raised doughnut with chocolate topping.... cream-filled, of course! They will even put custom writing on top if you want. It's like $5 and could feel a family of four. Go for it!

Then, there are various raised and cake/frosted doughnuts with toppings such as oreos, Captain Crunch, Cocoa Puffs, Rice Crispies, pixie stix, bubble gum, marshmallows, and yes.... even Tang.

One big word to the wise.... they only take CASH... so come prepared. Prices per doughnut range from about $1 each to $5, and I think a dozen is around $15 if you pick them out yourself. I highly recommend this every time you are in Portland.

They are located next door to a porno theater and across the street from a strip join on the edge of china town.

I got the ""Oh captain, my captain"" which is topped with vanilla frosting and cap'n crunch cereal. It was super good!!

It's part of the experience. Why be in such a hurry all the time anyways? 

The no name, dirt doughnut, bacon maple bar, etc. all these are a bit odd sounding at first, but they are amazing, especially after those nights when you've had more than a couple drinks. By far my favorite is the bacon maple bar. I try to get something I haven't tried when I come in, but the sweet, salty deliciousness of the bacon maple bar often wins me over.

This shop is the definition of Portland - complete with hipsters and smokers alike standing around outside. Voodoo is a tiny little shop so don't be surprised if there's a line extending outside the door. It goes by super fast unless you're stuck behind an indecisive donut eater. Voodoo is conveniently located next to a big alley filled with tables and plenty of seating if you want to eat your donut right away. 

They do have a ton of options here, might as well get at least a dozen! All of their flavors are listed on a chalkboard on the wall, but some of the uniquely named ones don't have descriptions, so you might just have to wing it. There's a rotating donut case too if you want to decide by looks instead of description. I didn't want anything crazy but nothing boring either, so I went with the Portland cream donut, nicely described as ""Portland's official doughnut."" Sounds good to me...and it was! It's chocolate glazed and inside there's a custard-type of cream... it almost reminded me of a Boston Cream Pie. The donut tasted dense and fresh, no wimpy grocery store donuts here. I also tasted my boyfriend's Voodoo donut and the Mango Tango donut. The Voodoo donut is more for its looks - since they decorate it just like a Voodoo doll. Tasty, but it's basically just a chocolate frosted donut. The Mango Tango donut was really good though - packed with mango flavored jelly and topped with a thick glaze. That was probably my favorite of the three, since it was the most unique... you rarely see a Mango donut at your neighborhood donut store!

I walk into work one day and there is a doughnut on my desk.... it looks like a maple bar with bacon on it..... my boss smiles and says eat!!! I looked at him confused because it is a maple bar...... with bacon...... I say....but I hate maple bars..... his response.... I know.... but you wont hate this one. It took me ten mins to gather up the courage to try this......not because of the bacon.... that was fine... I just REALLY hate maple bars lol. I finally take a bite ...... the heavens opened up and light for a moment seemed a bit brighter, the noise in the office went away, my cares.....what cares???? the next thing you know...... I am sitting there empty handed because I no longer had a bacon maple bar in my hand.... it had mysteriously disappeared..... I have been told I ate the whole thing lol.

so I have tried some of the other doughnuts before but my fav (other than the bacon maple bar.....) is the voodoo one with raspberry filling and a pretzel stick thru its evil little heart!!! 

I often get the bucket of leftovers to bring into work to feed the masses..... it is always a treasure hunt as we unpack them to see what goodies we have gotten. 

I also hate fritters.... I always have, a friend gave me a bite of hers and oh holy bageebees..... it was actually good ...... so they have now gotten me to like 2 types of doughnuts I previously hated...... (I dont know if that is actually a good thing or not lol) but the only place I have found that I liked them was the voodoo....mmmmmmmm (I am having a Homer Simpson moment) mmmmmmmm doughnuts......",2014-01-10 02:34:39

I was taking a few photos of the ""Keep Portland Weird"" mural when I felt my blood sugar drop...right across the street is Voodoo Doughnut.  I typically avoid tourist traps, but when hanger knocks, you must answer.

The shop itself is like old school punk meets 50s bakery...there are glass displays of every doughnut concoction available- including some covered in Froot Loops and Cocoa Puffs...and a decadent pastry covered in crunched up Oreos and peanut butter.

That particular doughnut is called the ""Old Dirty Bastard"", named after the late great rapper.  I ordered the ODB along with the ""Raspberry Romeo"", which is similar to a Krispy Kreme jelly donut (glazed on the outside).  

I equalized my blood sugar with the Raspberry Romeo, which was nice...lots of real raspberry jam in the middle, and the donut itself is very moist.  I saved the ODB for the flight back home.

The ODB is one of those things that need to be eaten in two sittings because the Oreos and PB makes the pastry profoundly HEAVY and DENSE!  That said, it was incredibly delicious and filling.  I wish I had gotten a dozen of those.

The service is a bit brusque, but not such that I wouldn't come back.  When I come back to PDX, I'll make a return visit...and yes, on a weekday afternoon, as the lines aren't as crazy then.",2014-10-08 20:29:11

A local institution that's [rightly so] received a TON of buzz, I wanted to simply pop in and see what all the fuss was about on my most recent trip up to Portland.  Instead of just gawking at the glorious treats that were on display, my tour guide told me that I had no choice but to get a delicious doughnut if I were to continue to hang out with him that night.

The pressure was on.  My eyes were on the verge of popping out of my head as I stood and stared at all the delectables within the revolving display case.  While I don't eat doughnuts with any sort of regularity, when I DO indulge myself with a fried carb concoction, I'm generally a purist and just adore the taste of French Crullers [though I didn't see any in sight].  Plus, I figured, ""...when in Rome, go big or go home"" and when it was our turn to order, I decided to get what resembled a maple bar.  To my surprise, when I bit in, it was filled with something white 'n' fluffy 'n' downright tasty!

My husband and I saw the lines... we didn't care to wait there for hours when we only had 72hrs in Portland so we passed by there a few different times of day and I'm sorry to say there was always a line... Always.

The place is 24hrs so that's kinda amazing that there's always a line but that also means the product is always fresh which I looooove.

I let dear husband sleep in and went alone Sunday morning to check out the portland rock n roll race as well as exercise my patience in line for our highly anticipated voodoo breakfast.

The line was zigged & zagged 2-3x over - probably 30 people in front of me, but it went pretty quickly since the order process is really not too complicated. 

The best part about the line was when the side door to the kitchen bust open and out came a voodoo-crazed cook with a banana/chocolate/peanut butter concoction - a one off - just an experiment they wanted some feedback on. Obviously I love free, I love sweets and I loooove giving my feedback so I was all over that!

So nice of them to know the lines annoying but show their gratefulness for your presence by handing out free creations!

As do Voodoo Doughnuts innuendos.  And they are very well marketed; the magic, IS indeed in the hole.

My top 3 favorites are: 
Maple Bacon Bar- those flavors go so perfectly together.
Gay Bar-  There are fruit loops on this donut. 
Grape Ape- lavender and grape!  Oh yes yes.  I love these flavors together too. 

The best thing about these donuts is the fact that they are always FRESH.  The dough practically melts in my mouth.  

Today it was raining and there was absolutely no line.  Usually I can see it from a mile away.  I call it the VDL: Visible Doughnut Line.   But today- none.  I had reached Mecca.  Through the wind and the rain.  Donning a broken umbrella.  And it was worth it, every step of he way. 

Best conversation from strangers: 
Homeless Man: ""You have a pink box."" Me: ""I am well aware."" Homeless man: ""You have some sugar on your chin."" Me: ""I was unaware, but I think I'll just keep it there. Thanks, though."" Homeless Man: ""Have a great day.""

Second best conversation- Lady on hotel elevator: ""Oh my! Voodoo donuts! I hear all about those on the food network! Is it worth the walk? How far is it? How many donuts are in that box? Do you work for the airlines?"" Me: ""Yes, .7 miles according to my phone, 13, yes.""

I am not in or from Portland, so I knew I had to buy a dozen to take home on my last visit. I only tried 12 of the doughnuts... so check their website for more variety/the cream filled ones (since those don't tickle my fancy).

The Voodoo Doll : This guy is a chocolate covered glazed raspberry jelly doughnut, with a pretzel rod jammed into it. This one was pretty tasty. It was a little much having it both glazed and covered in chocolate, somewhat of a sugar overload, but the raspberry jelly was so good. Now I wouldn't leave the pretzel in for too long... after my long plane ride home the pretzel had gotten soggy and weird. This one was one of my top picks. I think it was partially because of the jelly. That stuff tasted like real raspberry jam.

Maple Bacon Bar: You know that saying ""don't judge a book by its cover""?... the same applies to this doughnut. You cannot judge it until you try it (unless you are thinking, DAMN that looks good). This one was by far my favorite. It was like a hearty breakfast of pancakes with maple syrup and bacon. Bacon makes everything better. The doughnut was deliciously perfect, the maple frosting was not tooo sugary, but just enough mapley-ness, and the bacon was not greasy at all so its saltiness complimented the sugar quite nicely. My mate denied trying this until my begging/nagging/high pitched squeals of persistence annoyed him enough to try it. As much as he wanted to hate it... he loved it. The rest of the tasting gang truly enjoyed it too, even though some were hesitant at first. BOOM. so take it from me and just trust the bacon.

Dirt: This little munchkin is a regular doughnut with vanilla icing and Oreo cookies crumbled on top. They made sure not to skimp on the Oreos, which was nice. Dirt was pretty tasty. This one topped the hubby's list of favorites. It was simple, yet fun enough that your mouth had a good time eating it.  Having a glass of milk nearby also helps. Overall I would recommend this one for future guests.

Old Dirty Bastard (pardon my french): This fun concoction is comprised of: a doughnut, chocolate frosting, Oreo crumbles, and peanut butter. This was a richer version of the Dirt doughnut. It was tasty. Nothing I would exclaim about, but definitely worth a try. The peanut butter was a fun addition.

Butterfingerling: I really liked this one. I think it has something to do with the fact that I liked Butterfingers... but who knows. This doughnut was one of the smaller more condensed versions of the regular (instead of those big fluffy airy ones), with vanilla frosting and crushed Butterfingers. YUM. This wasn't overbearing in the least, and small enough that you don't feel too guilty combining 2 desserty things into one.

No Name: Regular doughnut, chocolate frosting, rice krispies, and peanut butter. Unfortunately I found the cereal to be stale. :/ It was a bit of a disappointment since I was really looking forward to a nice subtle crunch to compliment  the soft doughnut. The flavors weren't out of control, but if the rice krispies were crunchy... it would have been a whole lot better.

Diablos Rex: a little condensed chocolate doughnut, with chocolate frosting, a vanilla star design, chocolate chips, and red sprinkles! I love sprinkles. They make everything better... just like bacon. The chocolate chips were a super fun addition. I would give this one a go if you are into the whole chocolate thing.

Triple Chocolate Penetration: You would think with a name like Triple Chocolate Penetration that it would be a mouthful of chocolatey goodness. Nope. Although the doughnut itself was chocolate, with chocolate frosting, and coco-puffs, the coco-puffs were stale, and ruined the whole experience. I think Voodoo has to buy this cereal stuff in bulk, so more often than not their cereal infused creations will be stale. Heartbreaking. Crunchy chocolatey coco-puffs on even more chocolate sound like a dream.

Captain my Captain: This vanilla frosted, Captain Crunch encrusted doughnut would be a hit... but the cereal was (all together now...) stale. :/ so this was more of a bummer to try than anything. If you are a huge fan of the cereal though, I would just keep ordering it until you get non-stale encrustments. It looks pretty delicious otherwise.

The Loop: The Loop was the same as the Captain doughnut... except with stale Fruit Loops. If only I had known!! I would have saved myself the agony of trying all these tasty sounding doughnuts only to be sad I spent 2 bucks on each :( 

Marshall Matters: The eloquently named M&M covered doughnut was a hit! I love M&M's and since those cannot get stale, I enjoyed eating it very much. It was a simple doughnut with vanilla frosting, but it tasted and looked good! If you like M&M's then this one is definitely worth trying.

Raspberry Romeo: a powdered sugar, raspberry jelly filled doughnut. IT IS DIVINE. Anything with that raspberry jelly is worth it.",2013-11-13 01:09:59

I went into this place with an already well-developed LOVE for doughnuts. When I heard there was a doughnut place that was on the food network and supposedly exceptional RIGHT UP THE ROAD from where I was, there was no stopping me. 

The doughnuts are Freakin delicious! Mmmmm. So bomb. 

They get an extra star for creativity, with doughnuts such as bubble gum, captain crunch, the Gay bar, and even Cock and Balls (although I more than likely would never order it) I thought it was funny.  We got a ""Voo doo Dozen,"" which consists of the counter guy randomly picking different doughnuts for you.  With all the choices, that made life much easier, because I thought I'd never decide. :)

I visited Portland one July 4th weekend a couple years back. Our doorman at the Benson Hotel suggested we visit Voodoo Doughnut, and we stopped by two different times to find them closed (I think it was a combination of going there after midnight and going on a holiday). It wasn't until I got back home that I discovered how awesome they are, and the cult of Voodoo Doughnut. How can you not love a place that offers wedding packages that includes coffee and doughnuts for 10?

Recently some friends of mine returned from Portland with a dozen Voodoo doughnuts that they were nice enough to share with me. These were some of the most bizarre doughnut concoctions I'd ever seen. Among others there were: 
Glazed Cap'n Crunch
Cocoa Puffs on a Chocolate Doughnut
Chocolate Rice Krispies and Peanut Butter

Once we got the doughnuts, we had a variety of everything and all the doughnuts were so soft and fresh and delicious. My favorite was definitely the orange tang powdered one.

I love this place! I like the cute little hole! i almost missed it as I walked by until I saw a large ""Voodoo Doughnuts"" logo painted on the outer wall.  There was a long line that spills almost to the end of the block. That was at about 10p!

I decided to  limit my doughnut consumption to only during the morning, thinking the line would be much shorter after the rush hour. I was wrong it's still there as if it ever have been made short.

I ordered the pink doughnut with the bubble gum topped off, dirty old man, the huge ass fritter with chocolate ships and peanut butter, voodoo doughnut, M's, cocoa puff, The Maple bacon bar, cocks and balls, and maybe a couple more I might have eaten...

It was good....

The inside of the shop was really dark like a speakeasy, which seems strange for a doughnut shop, but Voodoo is no ordinary shop. The interior is quirky, with a giant doughnut on the wall and miscellaneous voodoo related artifacts. 

The 3 tier rotating donut display is properly illuminated. The donuts aren't labeled and the names (e.g., dirty old bastard) don't help out much either (plus the menu board was hard to read in the dim light). Donuts start at 95 cents. They have regular donuts, vegan donuts (many of these) and crazy donuts, like ones with Tang, M&Ms, Froot Loops, bacon, marshmallows, etc. http://media3.ct.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/0_p3XI8OQfwKXzXEfd7r9g/l

* Butterfingering doughnut: Chocolate cake donut with vanilla glaze and crushed Butterfinger bits: the donut was fresh and fluffy, BF adds this lovely crunch to the donut, really fabulous

* No name doughnut: Raised yeast donut with chocolate glaze, rice krispie treats, peanut butter drizzle: the cereal was not that crunchy, PB makes it interesting, rich, a little salty.

* Dirt doughnut: Raised round yeast donut with vanilla glaze, broken Oreo cookie pieces. The cookies weren't that crispy so the contrast wasn't there, super sweet so consume with a beverage...my least favorite.

What is there to say about this place that you haven't already heard?

Yes, there is a bacon donut. Yes, the lines are very long, especially at the original location and ESPECIALLY during Saturday Market hours.

Things that surprised me though were that although Voodoo is a special doughnut shop, the prices are very reasonable. It's not the cheapest, but it's a pretty good deal to buy donuts, especially by the dozen. 

When my friends and I were in Portland for a day, we decided to share a Voodoo dozen which is an assorted box of their custom donuts that are picked out by the worker - no requests. (The famous bacon donut is not included and needs to be ordered separately). Some were better than others, but since Voodoo lines are really long, rather than getting jeered at for taking too long to decide, do yourself and be a kind soul by just ordering a Voodoo dozen.

Portland has a few smallish-bakeries that offer really good donuts (if you think KK makes good donuts you are seriously out of touch).....  but even compared to places like Blue Star, Cannon Beach bakery and the Beaverton Bakery, Voodoo is pretty much the best there is.

In my opinion it is one of the reasons behind the ""weird"" in the saying ""Keep Portland Weird"".  I also give them a five star because they're not afraid to be daring and try really outlandish ways of turning a boring donut into something obscenely tasty while keeping the prices reasonable.  Prices range from $1 to $5 per donut.    

So far I have two favorites at this joint.  The first is the Triple Chocolate Penetration.  No...it isn't a porno title, it could be...actually it may have already been used but in this context...it isn't.  At Voodoo it is a chocolate cake donut with a coat of chocolate glaze topped with Cocoa Puffs...yes I said Cocoa Puffs.  The fine people over at Voodoo have a penchant for taking glazed donuts to new heights by topping the glaze with various cereals, cookies, candies, and even bacon.   You may have just asked yourself, ""Did he just say bacon...on a donut???  Blasphemy!!!""  Yes, the infidels at this hole in the wall on 3rd Ave top one of their donuts with strips of bacon, but more on that later.  Let me go on to my second most favorite donut...the Marshall Mathers.  This donut is so named because it's topped with mini M&M's.  Do you get it?  Beneath the M&M's is a white glaze covering a vanilla cake donut.  Sugar overload?  Yes, yes it is, but I love it!  We ordered several dozen Slim Shadys for our son's birthday party last year instead of doing the traditional birthday cake and they were a hit with the keikis.  The crazies at Voodoo even made a chocolate version of the Marshall Mathers (yes, I've thought of a funny joke or two about it).  So instead of the standard vanilla they sub it with a chocolate donut with chocolate glaze and then the minis.  These guys and gals also do custom donuts.  In addition to the 5 dozen Eminems, we had them custom make a Nemo (Finding Nemo) donut.  They melded several yeast donuts into the shape of the cute little fish and got artistic with some orange glaze accented with black and white here and there and Presto Change-O, FISH DONUT!  The finished product looked just like the little fishee our son loves.  We were thoroughly impressed and highly recommend them for special events.  

Now there are so many other donuts in the arsenal to try at this spot and I've only had the pleasure to sample a few.  I would love to sit down sometime and try them all but I also don't want the next Half Ton Man special on the Discovery Channel to feature yours truly.  So...I will have to choose wisely the next time we visit the place.  I really do want to try the Maple Bacon Bar, but I hear it is best to get it when the bacon is still freshly cooked.  Timing is everything.  I like my bacon crispy thank you.  The Memphis Mafia is another one on my hit list as well as the Dirty Snowballs.  The Memphis Mafia is an Elvis inspired creation and is larger than life like the legend himself.  The Dirty Snowballs...well, I'll just let your imagination run with it.  I will consume each in due time my friends, in due time.  I will be sure to update as I dispatch the sugary sweet prey.  

They opened a second larger location a while back just off of Sandy and Davis but the one on 3rd Ave in Old Town is open 24 hours.  Be warned...this doesn't mean they're making donuts the whole day.  These things are best sampled when they're fresh, especially the cereal topped ones.  Depending on the time of day, expect a line.  They don't take cards, cash only.  I believe there is an ATM inside, but of course it'll charge you a significant transaction fee.  Bring cash, spend the fee on a donut ;o)

As always, don't take my word for it.  Go out and try the place.

I was on my walk back to my hotel room as I saw a light at the end of the tunnel.

Once I got to step inside, my eyes fixated on one specific shelf of the many rotating displays. In a large black-sharpie written note was the word ""VEGAN"". I had to clarify with the staff that it was indeed vegan for never had I seen such a large variety of non-boring flavors. From bavarian maple to berry jam filled doughnuts, the selections for an egg, dairy, and meat omitting person were vast. It was like being a kid in a candy store only worse; I was a doughnut deprived vegan in a vegan friendly doughnut shop. 

Several months down the line and I officially moved to Portland. I was finally able to fill the missing element in my life: vegan doughnuts. From the day before orientation, to the day I moved into the dorms, to a very drunken night at Reed where I found a bucket full of these vegan perfections, to the day where a selection of maple bavarian creams, gay bars, and jelly filled passed through security with me on my way to New York ( I actually cared so much about the doughnuts not getting ruined that I accidentally left my computer in the scanning machine), the Doughnuts from Voodoo Doughnuts will always have a special place in my heart.",2014-08-08 05:59:03

Who cares! I'll still die happier and fuller than gramps did! Except for that third donut I'll never eat...

Voodoo had been so over-hyped to me by the time I got there that I was a little disappointed: Dingy homeless-chic decor, surly (*pre-caffienated?)hipster counterstaff, and the donuts look kinda... sorry, sad, malformed? but tasty? Nothing so slickly produced and attractively-manufactured looking as a Dunkin'-type. No, these little guys are delicious-looking special needs children made with lots of sloppy love - maybe ganja-fueled sloppy love? Now that I think of it, why doesn't Voodoo have a Mary Jane donut?

I digress.

I echo all the donut-specific comments made before now - particularly the bacon-maple bar - so bacon-riffic it could test the will of the kosherest of the khosher.

Oregon sounds like it'd be farm country to me, and farms equate to cheese in my not-so-worldly-wise head.

I called him this morning and asked, ""So... When are you coming back?""

""Tonight,"" he said.

""So did  you get me any cheese?""

""No, honey.  I asked and asked, and apparently, Oregon is not known for cheese. They're known for salmon, and you don't eat seafood.""

""People in Oregon fish?  I figured they'd farm.""

""No, honey. Fishies, no cows.""

How could I have missed out on this experience?!  How come I just DID NOT KNOW?!""

Bacon Maple Doughnut.

I know.  It sounds gross.  When I opened the bag, I eyed it dubiously, too.  But tsk tsk.  Let's all remember to have open minds.

This bar of freaking delicious goodness blew my damn mind wide open.

Hesitantly, I took a bite of this strange hybrid doughnut.  WTF is this, I muttered in my head as I chewed... and...

IT WAS AN OUT-OF-MY-MIND experience. The sweetness of the maple, the saltiness of the bacon, and the fried blandness of the doughnut itself...  Who'da thunk it?  UNBELIEVABLE HARMONY OF TASTES!

It's like... pancakes with bacon and maple syrup.  Or a Bacon, Egg, & Cheese McGriddle.  Or.. SOMETHING.

Frick.

I finished one in 0.7 seconds.  I have two more left in my precious white paper bag.  I folded over the top very securely, gave the BF the evil eye and announced, ""I'm going to put this in the fridge now.  I'm going to eat it for breakfast.  You cannot eat this.  It is mine.""

Selfish?  Heck yeah.  But it's just that damn good!

I've never ever ever harbored any interest in visiting the square state just north of my own, but now?

I think I need to book myself a one way ticket to Portland.  Preferably an air drop just in front of Voodoo.

This cult favorite was a wonderful surprise on a recent tour we took of the area. Our small group stopped in around 10:30pm on a Monday night end of summer and there was still a continuous line of about 15-20 people so I imagine the line can be around the block at peak days/times. I would suggest getting your morning doughnuts the night before in off hours or you will be waiting in a line around the corner. They are open 24 hours a day so pick a good late night time for your quick stop in.

We saw quite a few people walking out with full dozen boxes so clearly this was the right thought. Our tour guide suggested that the lines were the reason the immediate traffic lane next to the building was permanently roped off to auto traffic to accommodate the lines. There was also a security officer quietly hanging around the area so it seems well monitored and safe even though there is a huge transient population that hangs around the area. 

Out of the mixed box we got we tried the Grape Ape and The Loop doughnuts. The Loop was a fruit loop covered doughnut that was quite good but I have to say the unique flavor of the Grape Ape was the kicker for us. The doughnut has a grape dust on it that surprisingly had a sour candy taste to it that although shocking was really good. The doughnuts were perfectly soft, spongy and thick. I almost couldn't finish the one I had so they are very filling. 

This place has unique designs too that are perfect for parties such as the famous Voodoo Doll which is raspberry jelly filled and often has pretzel sticks to simulate the pins on a voodoo doll, and the enormous ""Cock-N-Balls"" bavarian cream filled doughnut. 

I thought this would be more of a tourist trap and a novelty but the unique creations were actually REALLY good. Recommend you try every flavor =)

Unfortunately they haven't figured out a way to ship their doughnuts yet otherwise I would be a repeat customer! Will have to wait until my next trip to the area. *sigh*",2017-09-07 23:49:31

Everyone pretty much agrees that donuts aren't the best thing for you, too much sugar, but as a once-in-a-while treat they're a lot of fun to look at, to order, and to amuse out-of-town recipients with. To Voodoo's credit, they strongly discourage shipping their donuts since the process greatly degrades the donuts. Fresh, fresh, fresh. The kids in my family enjoy choosing donuts and also putting themselves into a sort of a donut-coma every once in a while. No complaints.

They make some of the best donuts in the world, and have dozens of different vegan options daily. Conveniently open 24/7, this original location is placed in downtown Portland, steps from many hotels, bars, and restaurants. The interior is colorful and kitschy, painted bright pink and decked out in cute donut themed art. The available flavors are displayed in large rotating cases, providing a whimsical browsing experience. 

Regardless of their 24/7 hours, Voodoo is a busy place that nearly always has a line. I typically come here late at night and have never waited more than 20 minutes, but apparently mornings and weekends can be extremely hectic, so plan accordingly. 

While I have enjoyed every vegan donut that I've tried from here, my favorites are the vegan Voodoo doll, and any variation of their chocolate cake donut. The cute voodoo doll shaped donut is a classic vanilla raised filled with strawberry jelly, and topped with a rich chocolate ganache icing. Their chocolate cake donuts are moist and light, with an authentic cocoa flavor that is never overpowered by whatever topping you choose (sprinkles, ganache, Cocoa Puffs, etc!).

Yes, I've heard the naysayers but I think Voodoo's doughnuts are unique, fun and tasty.  Yes, other places have good doughnuts too, but do they have a maple bacon bar or a voodoo man doughnut that squirts out yummy red, ""bloody"" filling?  I think not.  And the mango doughnut with tangy powdered topping is to die for.  I've also enjoyed the large apple fritters. 
I have warm memories of a former roommate who was vegan and used to bring home a half dozen of their vegan doughnuts and we'd wolf them down.  Not the healthiest dinner, but it was fun.  The vegan style treats are more like cake doughnuts, but I love that and they're super tasty. 
Of course it's a touristy place, it's fun to go to a place with wacky doughnuts and wait in line for something special.

And the lady who gave us our doughnuts, was nice. Gave me a huge smile when I gave her a tip (the two people in front of my didn't give her anything so I threw in an extra dollar a piece for them) and when I nearly knocked my Cock and Balls on the floor (because I am clumsy, no fault of theirs) she tried to help me catch it and said the signature line my friend and I repeated for the rest of her trip, ""Careful with that cock now.""

The donuts (or doughnuts - I prefer the shorter one) here are wicked good. When you go, you have to try the Maple Bacon Bar. ""What is that you say? Bacon on a donut?!"" Yes. And it's amazing.

My other favorite is the one with Oreos on it (not the most creative I suppose, but still delicious). Oh...and the Memphis Mafia, that's really good too. 

As noted in some earlier reviews, the people who work here are not always the friendliest. I don't hold that against them though because they deal with tourists all day and the name of the shop is ""Voodoo Doughnut"" not ""Rainbow, Sunshine and Sprinkle Doughnut"". Since I live in Portland and have been here several times, I would never wait in a long line because that's just silly. There are often long lines here, but it's hit and miss.

People say you're overrated.

People say you're not worth the wait.

I DISAGREE.

I experienced plenty of action.

Your sweet, sweet holes were totally worth the wait.

Well I suppose the holes were just air, but by golly the pastry around the holes was unforgettable.

You were the only request by my husband, and while carrying a giant box across the Pacific is not my idea of a jolly good time, I acquiesced because I love him.  And because I really wanted a reason to order 18 donuts.

And order I did.  18 random donuts off your gloriously packed but non-descriptive menu.  I left it to the universe and magic and faith because I was in Portland and in Portland people are wild and FREEEEEEE!

I then dragged your pastries back home to Hawaii with me where they began to sweat a little bit, and by the time we ate them it had been nearly 24 hours since their purchase.

But OH the glory.  The Maple Bacon had the most mysteriously crisp and delicious bacon strips.  The grape donut was bizarre but wonderful.  The everything-else-we-had-that-I don't-know-what-they-were-called were amazing taste explosions.  Except for the Captain Crunch, which wilted terribly on the trip over, but that's not important.

What's important is how you've ruined me.

How you have ruined us.

How we are now unintentionally donut monogamous but ALAS, true to a bakery over the mother fricking sea.

This was one place that I had on my agenda as a must do since I missed it the last time I was there. I first tried the original location on SW 3rd Ave. However, the line was waayyy to long so I went for the Davis Street location. Score! The line wasn't too bad at all. I felt like a kid all over again as I looked into the big window looking at all the different donuts that I could pick. By the time I got up to the counter I was so ready to order....I went for the Bacon Maple Bar and also the Memphis Mafia donut. 

The Bacon Maple Bar is as good as it sounds. The crisp bacon offered up the perfect texture and flavor to the smooth sweet taste of the maple bar. Honestly, I could have eaten around 5 of these in one sitting. 

After wolfing down the Bacon Maple Bar, I dug into the Memphis Mafia donut which is a huge donut reminiscent of an apple fritter, except this delight has chunks of banana, cinammon, peanut butter. chocolate, chocolate chips, and peanuts. There were a lot of tastes going on, but it was insanely good. It was so sweet that I couldn't eat it all at once. However, in all fairness I did start eating this right after the Bacon Maple Bar so my body was probably in shock from all the sugar. 

Both were good, but my favorite was the simpler Bacon Maple Bar. They have an extensive menu so the next time I am up there I am planning on giving the Voodoo Doll donut a try, and of course I have to get that Bacon Maple donut again.

Should you go? YES! Just remember, if you don't want to wait in as long of a line consider the Davis location. There is also a parking lot in that location as well.

I love you Voodoo Donut.",2013-09-16 05:22:56

I was shocked at how delicious and moist the donut still was, after the time and travel.

My girlfriend and I were visiting Portland, so we decided to stop by the famous Voodoo Doughnuts for a late night snack. The line was out the door but not quite as long as I was picturing that it might be beforehand. We only waited in line for about 10-12 minutes before reaching the front of the line. 

In the mean time, we were fortunate to see someone taking on the Tex-Ass doughnut challenge in which one has a mere 80 seconds to engulf a Texas-sized doughnut roughly equal to six normal-sized doughnuts. This man made the challenge seem remarkably simple as he proceeded to inhale the doughnut while the staff chanted ""Eat that ass!"" repeatedly and his children jumped up and down yelling their own G-rated words of encouragement. He made the challenge seem so easy, that I almost mentally talked myself into doing it, before realizing how silly I was. I saw that guy sitting outside afterwards, and the look on his face seemed to betray more than a little regret and perhaps an upset stomach. 

My girlfriend and I ended up ordering five different doughnuts:
1. Captain my captain doughnut - I really enjoyed the crunchiness of the cereal and the textural contrast it provided to the fluffiness of the doughnut. The vanilla frosting really made the doughnut incredible. This is what a complete breakfast should be. 
2. Portland cream doughnut - The Bavarian cream was rich and decadent. I think the chocolate frosting complemented the cream really well too.
3, 4. Marshall Mathers doughnut and the Diablos Rex - My girlfriend ordered these. I didn't try either one, but she said they were good.
5. Glazed doughnut - Overall, the raised doughnuts were light and fluffy. The glaze was sweet and simple. 

This place takes cash only, but there are definitely ATM machines around the area. 

If you are visiting Portland and love doughnuts (the second qualifier is probably unnecessary), you should check out Voodoo Doughnuts.

To Voodoo Doughnuts, I say: ""Now go do that voodoo that you do so well.""",2016-04-25 03:06:21

I tried their Bacon Maple Bar and raspberry-filled Voodoo Doll. Both were excellent and very satisfying. Most of the doughnuts are sugar bombs, so be warned.

Tip #1 - View their website beforehand to see what doughnuts they have. They have QR codes posted outside the shop, so you can pull up their menu while you're waiting in line.

Tip #2 - A friend gave this piece of advice afterwards. You go in and buy a bunch of doughnuts and just have a bite of each. I guess that means you can give the rest to some of the homeless people in the area. The doughnut shop is in a seedy part of town.

Served immediately and presented with a menu while the girl behind the counter asked me what flavor profile I typically like - I went with the maple bacon bar because people raved about it and I *love* salty sweet combinations and *I HAD TO* get the voodoo doll, filled with strawberry preserves and a pretzel stick in his check, just for a photo op and to try.

Which really baffled me: people would be waiting on line for 20+ minutes and only at the register, start to think about what to order.

Anyway, this location seems to be a doughnut churning factory. The bf and I ended up getting one of their voodoo dolls, of course, along with a bacon maple bar, a Oh Captain, My Captain doughnut, and a buttermilk bar. I also got one of their coffees, which was a pretty good cup of coffee. We saw at one of the tables outside the establishment as the inside was way too packed with people to try to even eat our treats at. I tried the voodoo doll first, and it was a pretty good doughnut: the dough was fresh and yeasty, and the frosting, while being pretty sweet, paired well with the jelly filling. The bf loved his bacon maple bar, and the other two, we had the next day. 

Was it the best doughnut I ever had? No, but it was still pretty good. It's silly and maybe a bit overrated, but it's pretty darn Portland-esque, and if you're really bothered with the lines, you can try to go really early in the morning as it is open 24 hours on most days. I enjoyed their silliness and would tell other tourists to come swing by if they happened to be in town, too.",2019-04-21 16:14:38

Back when I was in high school Voodoo used to be open from 6p.m. to 6 a.m., and they used to sell doughnuts filled with pepto bismol and nyquil. On my last trip to Portland I stumbled into voodoo late, and it was like nothing had ever changed! My personal favorite is the no name: peanut butter, rice crispies, and chocolate sauce. It's awesome! Though the one with coco puffs is a close second.

Cons-- If you're looking for a sit down full on breakfast, I'd go elsewhere as they're just about doughnuts. In addition, lines can be long here, and it's best to avoid peak hours.

Although I received many recommendations for the ""maple bacon"" donut, I just couldn't get myself to try it haha. A lot of their donuts are a bit off, but are apparently delicious. However, I decided to play it safe & get the cap'n crunch & homer simpsons donut. They were both actually so tasty & so full of flavor. The bread wasn't too soft nor too hard, and I definitely enjoyed both of them. 

The cap'n crunch basically consisted of white frosting topped with cap'n crunch and fruity pebbles. A bit of a mouthful to bite but I loved it. The homer simpsons donut is just like the pink donuts on the tv show, with sprinkles on top. It was simple & delicious. 

I don't think I'll go out of my way if I visit Portland again for Voodoo Doughtnut, but I guess it's just kind of a ""yeah I've tried Voodoo Doughnut before"" kind of hype. Probably worth trying at least once if you're a tourist just like me!",2017-01-27 01:49:24

He came back with a Butterfinger donut and an apple fritter for me. First off, the fritter is the size of my face. Almost too large for a donut. I took a bite and realized what the fuss was about. SO GOOD! I couldn't eat more than a few bites and saved it for the next morning. STILL GOOD.

I don't know what these haters are talking about.
I know there is a HUGE hype about this place, but it's still some bomb ass doughnuts. Comparable to the softness, warmth, and deliciousness of Krispy Kreme.
My first doughnut was the Bacon Maple Bar. So damn good! $3 and well worth it.
My second was the Old Dirty Bastard which had caramel, PB, oreo, and I think one other thing. It was the perfect doughnut. I'm salivating.
Lastly, I got a box to go and had another Bacon Maple and the Captain Crunch.
The staff is HILARIOUS and so great!

I bought two doughnuts: the voodoo doll and the bacon maple bar. Yes, bacon on maple bar. I had the bacon maple bar right away. Bacon and maple actually were good together! The bacon was thick, perfectly cooked, and not overpowering salty. Maple bar itself was just GREAT!!! Man, writing this makes me want one right now!!!

The maple bar filled me up, so I saved the voodoo doll one for the next day, which was still good. It didn't get rock hard. It was still soft. To be honest, it was too sweet for me and I'm actually a big sweets lover. The voodoo doll was covered with chocolate and filled with A LOT of jelly. I couldn't finished it. Well, maybe it was because I had it for breakfast.

If I ever had the chance to go back to Oregon, I will definitely make a couple of stops at this place to get more of bacon maple bars and try some other items.

The donuts are inspired, creative, cakey, and GOOD!  Donuts elsewhere are over-glazed, or merely fluffy-nothingness.  What other donut place would have the audacity to make a NyQuil donut, merely to have the FDA tell them to pull it from the shelf?  (urban legend alert - I cannot confirm this story).  Blazers Blunts? Cock N Balls? MnM's on donuts? Bacon on Maple bar? Tang flavored donut?  Oreo Cookie and Peanut Butter topping?  YUM!!!!

The place is tiny, dirty, and funky.  They have random spoken word nights here, Swahili language lessons, poetry readings, and other random-ass performances.  The place is open odd hours, going late into the night, and often closed in the middle of the day.  There's nothing like a fresh apple fritter at 3am when you're drunk.  Especially when you are in a confined space with a bunch of other drunk or crazy people while scarfing it down. One night I was in there at 230am, and there were ~20 drunken clowns (the big shoe, red nose, white face kind of clowns) running around and causing general chaos.  Only in Portland... only in Portland.

I have never met anyone who, once they have tried VooDoo, thinks any other donut is nearly as good.  As usual, the locals in PDX put the bullshit national corporate chain food to shame.  

Bring a Dozen (13 donuts chosen at random by the staff  - $8+change) to work in the pink box, and your co-workers will have a new-found and undying respect for you!

Never in my wildest dreams did I ever picture myself waiting over an hour for doughnuts! 

""Doughnuts!!! Nahhh!!! Did you see that line?!""

I always thought of myself as a sophisticated cupcake connoisseur, so when I saw the line for doughnuts, I hesitated a bit, but after a few minutes of research on my smart phone, I learned they were recognized as one of the top 10 doughnut bakeries in the U.S., which made me suddenly crave a bite of one of their customized voodoo doll shaped delicacies bacon eclairs.

As I stepped into line, I thought to myself, ""How am I going to withstand a full hour wait?"", but it was quite easy because right outside the line was a street folk/ hillbilly inspired band. I watched a young woman strum on a hardware saw with a bow, and the music created was heavenly to my ears. I recommend you drop a dollar for them. They seem like they work hard.

The line went by quickly, since I was playing Temple Run on my cell phone, and as I entered the store, the visual displays were appealing. There were all types of doughnuts-- the classic glazed ones, jumbo ones the size of your face, Oreo drizzled delights, doughnuts covered in cereal, and a few covered in bacon. My favorites were the bacon and oreo ones. They are quite heavy but worth the money.

If you come here, please bring cash! They only accept cash! Also, don't be afraid to be experimental. Everything is delicious here. Also, if you plan to buy a lot to fill a box, be careful because everyone stares at you like you have a load of cash in there! I got so many crazy hungry looking stares as I walked the street with one of their pink boxes.

This place is a highly recommended place for anyone visiting Portland! A definite tourist attraction and classic hipster hotspot.",2013-07-17 02:12:17

I would strongly recommend the Portland Creme donut.  It's the one with the two eyes!  It's filled with a delicious Bavarian cream, and covered with a great chocolate coating.

I can't get enough to be honest, the doughnuts are made fresh- with hipster bumping heavy metal in the back kitchen which is viewable thru the windows guarded by metal bars and golden glitter painted brick in the line. 

This place has such character, the chandelier interior with doughnut stained glass with the choc board menu full of hilarious items that taste ooo sooo good... gotta wipe the maple frosting off my fingers as I type this out. The menu will consist of funny names such as ""old dirt bastard""
Which is basically crack, it's a doughnut with a Bavarian cream like filling topped with crumbled Oreos drizzled with a maple frosting-- lemme just say I can't get enough. The wild ones they have are: ""the blunt"" a soft warm twisted dough covered in cinnamon and topped with frosting at the tip that makes this thing lit on more then one accord.

The grape ape it's another one on this menu that is something you can't get anywhere else- but goes with how lit this place is. Some hilarious items on the menu on top of all the other creative cereal covered (captain crunch, fruit loops, coco pebbles) is the cock and balls. Yes you read that right.

A lot of other donut places are popping up and try to be just like Voodoo and to no avail.  Weird, funky flavors that just work on perfectly risen yeasted donut.  People try - but they are no Voodoo.

I didn't always love Voodoo this much, I think for a couple of reasons.  It only accepted cash until this year & I am a millennial cash is not something I ever carry around.  And unless you went at 7AM you were waiting in a 15 minute line at least.  I think the lines have gone down because Voodoo isn't just a Portland thing anymore its expanded to other cities so if you're in Portland it's not a MUST anymore.

But their donuts are always so fresh and perfectly risen, the icing is on THICK not that runny stuff, and their flavors are unmatched.

My favorites:
- Any of the maple ones because they have the best maple icing in the land - could eat it by the spoonful (bacon maple bar, maple cream, regular maple bar, etc.)
-Guava Colada
-Blueberry cake
-Apple Fritter
-School Daze

Quite often these places are cliché, and the locals love to hate on them because they become too popular, and it's always cool to talk about how something that was once awesome no longer is. If you hate on Voodoo though, you better have a damn good reason, because they do live up to the hype, even after sitting in the rotating wheel (http://www.flickr.com/photos/wedoitforlove/4327453148/) of doom for hours. Sure, if you pay $5 for the giant chocolate smothered, crème filled, phallic monstrosity then you kind of deserve what you're getting (take that however you want), but if you actually branch out and try a variety of their other combinations (http://www.flickr.com/photos/wedoitforlove/4327418724/) you'll see this place is worth the visit.

The interior of Voodoo is unique, to put it mildly (http://www.flickr.com/photos/wedoitforlove/4326754065/). The assortment of donut (sorry, I don't care for their spelling) paraphernalia is unrivaled, and augmented in many twisted ways by the other random accessories adorning the walls. In fact, there are probably even more unrelated items on the walls than there are donut themed, many of which are quite comical. The donuts themselves come in every color unnatural to man (http://www.flickr.com/photos/wedoitforlove/4326692527/), many of which take you back to flavors from your childhood, with several of them being cereal themed. They've even got vegan donuts (http://www.flickr.com/photos/wedoitforlove/4326732447/), if for some reason you enjoy mixing pleasure with pain (all kidding aside, I've actually heard from several vegans these are quite good as well).

Since it was already 12:30, I had been eating virtually all day, and had to drive 3 hours back to Seattle and wake up around 7am for work the next day, I figured the best option would be to just get a couple dozen (http://www.flickr.com/photos/wedoitforlove/4327505570/) donuts to take into the office so nobody questioned me as I passed out at my desk that day from a Portland overdose. I decided just to let them pick the donuts, because at $8.50 for a dozen if they choose that's a pretty sweet deal in my mind. He did let me add a couple that I wanted too, which made it all the more worthwhile. One box was heavily loaded with crunchy toppings (http://www.flickr.com/photos/wedoitforlove/4327526780/) and basic options, while the other featured a lot of cereal based (http://www.flickr.com/photos/wedoitforlove/4326805005/) donuts along with some sweeter toppings like coconut. 

Throughout the week we ended up piecemealing the donuts bit by bit among our team, everyone taking bits of various ones as they walked by each day. As a result I got to taste almost everything, and although I can't recall the names of all of them, I definitely really enjoyed about 75% of all the ones I tried, a pretty hefty percentage considering how much they play around with toppings. Obviously the maple bacon bar (http://www.flickr.com/photos/wedoitforlove/4326698991/) stole the show, and rightfully so. This thing is like magic. It just hooks you, and you suddenly want several dozen of just that one. I would have never guessed such a simple combination could be so amazing, but it's true. I was also a huge fan of the ""dirt"" donut covered in Oreos, and the Portland crème pie (http://www.flickr.com/photos/wedoitforlove/4327448502/) which is as fun to eat as it is to look at. Pretty much anything with coconut on top was a hit, although if there was anything I didn't care for too much it was the cereal based donuts, with the exception of the peanut butter glazed donut topped with rice krispies.

If you're knocking Voodoo my guess is that you didn't have a maple bacon bar, and if you DID have one and you're still knocking it, well then I can't help you. Some things are idyllic for a reason, and Voodoo has created their own little slice of fantasy out on the West coast.",2010-08-10 17:53:06

The line on a Sunday afternoon was insanely long though and moved really slowly.  I couldn't figure out why it was moving so slowly until I went in myself and saw all the cute decoration and huge doughnut selection inside.  I think people were getting held up taking photos and picking donuts.  I ended up waiting about 1hr and 15 min, but it was really worth it! I would wait again next time I'm in the Portland area. 

My friend and I actually ordered the same donuts, and both agreed that they are simply amazing! Here's what I tried:

- VOODOO DOLL : It's so cute! It's really nice how each voodoo doll is a little different, giving them some character.  It's a yeast donut so it's nice and fluffy, and filled with a raspberry jelly and chocolate frosting.  This was the cutest, but actually my least favorite because it tasted more like a common jelly donut.

- BACON MAPLE BAR : My favorite~ This was so delicious, that I'm just drooling right now thinking about it.  Bacon and maple frosting sound like a really weird combination, but trust me, it works! The salty bacon was thick and crispy and it went really well with the sweet maple. It's another yeast donut, so it was very soft and fluffy.  Mine actually just came out of the fryer, so it was still warm, making it even more delicious.  
 
- PORTLAND CREAM : Bavarian cream with chocolate frosting is uber yummy.  I love bavarian cream in cakes and donuts.  The two eyeballs on the side were really cute too.

- MEMPHIS MAFIA : This was a massive donut in size and weight.  It's one of the sweeter, denser donuts, but somehow it was still crispy.  It has chocolate chips with peanut butter and chocolate frosting. Since it's not a yeast donut, it tastes just as good the second day.",2010-10-31 04:48:50

My son marveled at the sparkling brick and clever menu and I knew bringing him for his first voodoo experience was a worthwhile venture even if the doughnuts were only sub-par now.

We wandered through Saturday market for a while after we got them, another stop I hadn't made in many years. He was a walking Voodoo commercial with his hoodie on and his pink box and got a lot of smug comments, but he totally didn't care at all. We walked to a park bench and split a couple donuts.

Yes, it is off the wall, eccentric and a bit pricey, BUT what do you expect?  You come for the experience.  If you want a plain $.50 cake doughnut, go elsewhere.  Voodoo is a Portland Iconic spot.  When you visit, you have to get a doughnut (or a dozen, whoops).  Last time I was down here I didn't bring my son and accidentally took a bite of each doughnut before he got home. This last time around I planned on only getting 6...again walked out with a dozen and the kiddo ate a majority of them this time.  I bribed a few bites. 
Anyways, there is generally always a line out the door but it moves quickly, use the time as a good touristy photo opp!

I did see a sign that turned me off: cash only. 

The following morning, we were due at the airport no later than 11am.  We had breakfast plans already but after we left our hotel, he asked his mom to make a stop by Voodoo for me... 

I didn't have any cash on me but his mom gave me a few bucks.  I ran into the store w/ him and the first thing I did was check in (of course), took pictures, and when I came up to the counter, I asked the guy what he recommends for a chocolate lover.  After a few suggestions, what he described stuck to me like a leech: Old Dirty Bastard... almost like a regular glazed donut w/ Oreos and peanut butter.  There are 2 things that I love: Oreo's and peanut butter.. if you put the 2 together that means it's a definite ""Tram"" selection.

The donuts run between one and two dollars apiece and they've got an incredible variety! Everything from relatively simple donuts with fancy frosting, all the way to cereal covered donuts and jelly filled donuts that looks like the gingerbread man being stabbed... Quite lovely!

The raspberry jelly might get messy, but it was so good! My second favorite would be the Grape Ape. I love the subtle tarty taste. The Mangotango was very similar with the sprinkles/""dust"". I got the Dirt instead of the Dirty Bastard because I didn't care for peanut butter, and it was a good standard Oreo flavored doughnut. Portland Cream was actually filled with custard.

We arrived at 12:30am and there were a few people in the shop but the line wasn't out the door, thank goodness. I couldn't decide, there were a lot of different flavors! The BF and I decided two each so he ordered the bacon maple bar and the maple blazer blunt and I ordered the grape ale and orangatang doughnut. The four came out to be like $10? Expensive for doughnuts but so worth it.

The bacon maple was so freaking good. The bacon was cooked perfectly and the maple glaze wasn't too sweet. The BF and I split this one, although I could have eaten the whole doughnut by myself. The orangatang was refreshing. It tasted like an orange doughnut. The grape ale was similar. It was refreshing with a strong grape taste. The orange and grape were really good and different than your typical flavored doughnut. Sadly, we didn't get to try the maple blazer blunt because we were so full.  So bummer.

I don't know if other yelpers feel this way but when you have a place bookmarked for soooo long and you finally get to go it's such a great feeling! Especially if the place is super far from you, or if it's a super hyped-up place it adds onto the excitement. I felt the same way about going to Café du Monde in New Orleans last month.

I never had a reason to ever head out to Portland but low and behold my sister ends up marrying a guy from Vancouver,WA so my family spent Thanksgiving this year with the in-laws. My brother-in-law and his mom drove us here on Wednesday and we came around 10:15am. I always heard about the super long line that wraps around the corner. Surprisingly, when we came the line was short and did not even extend out the door. We got to order our doughnuts within 5 minutes. They play oldies music inside which my dad loved!

We tried the most popular flavors: Voodoo Doll, Bacon Maple Bar, The Loop, Oh Captain My Captain, and Dirt. In all honesty, the doughnuts taste like an average doughnut. The only thing that sets it aside from other doughnuts is the decoration and toppings. Other than that if there were a blind fold test Voodoo Dougnut doesn't taste special. It's still super fun to get to try a world famous place!

It was just aiiight, tbh.

For the 2nd time, I was able to visit the ORIGINAL Downtown Portland location - and well, it was aiiight - but the location was so-so. I wasn't impressed that it seemed sketchy when we went (probably because we went at night - it's not advisable, just go in the daytime!) | parking would be better at night, though - you could snag a spot right close to it, but there would be some panhandlers near you. Stay safe & sound!

On another note, I was blown away & taken aback by the creativity and variety of selection, however the taste - not so much. It seemed that with all the glitz, and glamour, and dazzle of each donut & how it was made/decorated - it simply fell way below my expectations of how it's originally in Portland & what's it made it famous & quite popular. It does meet the average doughnut expectation, but if you're asking of the freshness of the quality & the distinctiveness of Voodoo Doughnuts from other donut shops/chains, it just wasn't there. It seems odd I'm still giving a 5-star review, but, for the sake of its uniqueness and weirdness, then why not?! The other plus side, is their workers are SUPER friendly and accommodating! Having stepped in around 10 or 11 p.m.- ish on a weekend night, the workers didn't show no sign of being lazy, or having ignored us once we stepped inside - but rather, catered to our needs & asked us what we wanted! Good customer service is always a good sign for quality service, wish I could say that about their donuts LOL.

Overall, it's just all for show, and nothing quality about it - I guess it's truly about quality NOT quantity. It really is all about the hype here at Voodoo. If you haven't eaten a doughnut here, you aren't missing out on much. You can simply go to your local grocery store, pick up a box of cereal, grab a glazed or chocolate doughnut from your local doughnut shop, and throw everything together. That's just how i feel.

I've heard the line goes down the block on the weekends, I happened to visit on a rainy Tuesday afternoon and had no wait at all. Situated on a corner, the storefront is very small and grunge is the vibe. This is not your average cutesy bake shop.

Seventy-Five-Fucking-Minutes of my time that was entirely all too worth every damn second. Yes, it was worth it. Would I wait in that line again, probably not. But visiting Portland, everyone has to try this place at least once. The magical question of the 75 minute wait was ""do these doughnuts have drugs in them?""

So no, there are no drugs in the doughnuts, but you really feel like it when you have a 5 minute long moment of euphoria and tingles all over your body after consuming a maple bacon bar or ODB (Old Dirty Bastard).

The place is a lot smaller than expected (pretty much a hole-in-the wall), and is located in a very ghetto/janky area of Portland, but I think this is what makes the experience so much more authentic.

It isn't all decked out or clean looking at all -- in fact, on the contrary -- it's really dirty looking and there are vagabond-esqe people and scruffy dogs sitting in front and all around the block. 

But that's what makes this place SO cool and so genuine.

Also, they're opened until really late (2 or 3am) and open ridiculously early - so you can come practically 24/7!

If I lived in Portland...I definitely could see myself coming back here for a good splurge very often.

Be aware though -- parking is really hard! (Atleast on a Friday night..)",2009-11-07 11:34:00

We came here a bit after our friend and she suggested that go to voodoo to check out one of Portland's pride jewels. Not kidding, it was foodgasm and I don't even like donuts. I never eat donuts. The thought of doughnut has never been appealing to me. This, my friends, was seriously mind blowing. 
The place is open 24/7, which is good if you want donuts after a night out partying, for breakfast or just for no reason at all because you are a free human and if you want donuts at ungodly hours you might as well get them!!! 
We ordered 3, and it was hard not to order more for 2 adults trying to not gain a million pounds while eating our way through Portland. The lady behind the counter was so kind and helpful (and she had a great style) helped us narrow down the sugar bombs that would become ours. We ordered 2 dough-y ones: a dirty old bastard with vanilla frosting, cookie crumbs and peanut butter drizzle and a dirt one, vegan I believe with vanilla frosting and crushed Oreos. We also ordered a cake one, much smaller and more reminiscent of your traditional donut, with crushed up butterfingers on top, our Voodoo representative's favorite! 
Have I said OMG yet?!! While all 3 of them were to die for, the big ones were our favorite. The texture of the dough was very light and fluffy, it reminded me of a delicate brioche bread. The toppings were decadent and outrageously amazing. It's the bomb. 
I have heard that there is a rivalry for the best donuts in town between Voodoo and the Blue Star, and Voodoo definitely takes the medal by miles! (We compared... haha).

My review is basically for one donut, the blunt donut. It is a cinnamon donut dipped in maple and covered in sprinkles at the end. Get this donut. 100% awesome.

It's definitely a tourist thing, but you can't leave Portland without getting one of these. Cash only. But to my shock, two donuts came to $2.30. What the hell? I came with a $10 and was expecting not to have enough money for two donuts. When she gave me over $7 back I thought there must have been a glitch in the matrix. I'm used to Georgetown Cupcakes where you pay $3 for a small cupcake. Here, you can get a giant donut for a dollar and some change.

Huge variety - unlike any donut shop i have been to before. I always get the Bavarian cream and it was on point. The coconut guava filled donut was also excellent and so was the earl grey donut.

We pretty much knew what we wanted because of the pictures. It's a great visual for kids too so they can just point at which one they want. The public restrooms were closed due to Covid so good luck finding a restroom in downtown Portland cuz it's basically impossible. I think I paid with Apple Pay. The donuts were fun to eat.

I'm glad we did because on Monday, there was a line and we didn't have time to wait. CASH ONLY.  I'm sure if there was a line, I wouldn't have been as happy, but ease of our experience and the great tasting donuts makes this 5 stars! We got the $24 dozen and had them chose. I ate a bite (or more) of each and throughout the rest of the trip, they stayed good and I nibbled on some every morning. It made my day. The box itself was cute!

Atmosphere: 4/5. It's cute and neon-colored. I get a trendy/punky vibe from this place.
Service: 4/5: Quick and efficient

Let's move on to the stars of the show, the donuts. 
Donuts: 5/5 Honestly, I was glad I had them pick, because I wouldn't have been able to. I would have shied away from the crazy looking ones. There were a few I didn't like in the box, but that was due to personal preference, not because they tasted bad. 

They were each unique and actually very delicious. The donuts (old-fashioned and not) batter was good in and of itself outside of the craziness on top. If I didn't like the donut toppings, I'd just pick at the bottom because the donut was so fluffy and delicious. It would be impossible to list them out. 

Notables:
-They look awesome in photos! Be jealous, my friends of my beautiful box of colorful and crazy looking donuts!
-Grape-flavored donut (the purple one!) was so intensely strong so if you like grape-flavored things, get this! This was unique.
-Voodoo donut: So cute and unique. Tasted good too!
-Oreos on donut: My personal favorite! But then again, I also love cookies and creme ice cream.
-The old-fashioned batter (not chocolate) had nutmeg in it which I love!

Cons:
Cereal was stale. Was that on purpose?
Peanut butter chocolate wasn't my taste preference
Maple Bacon was okay, but I'm not the biggest bacon fan. The bacon seemed old.

Didn't think I could write this much about donuts... XD. I don't even like donuts that much, but this is something you can't find anywhere else (that I know of). I'll stop here before it becomes a novel.",2016-09-22 19:17:14

Sure they make their living here with doughnuts but of the menu items that I tried, their apple crueller was actually the best.  They do not skimp on the apple fillings and the thing is absoultely huge.  I could have eaten the thing for a full breakfast for sure.  The sprinkle doughnut was above average though, yeah, just a doughnut.  But the price was surprisingly reasonable considering that this place could charge literally anything and people would still come through for treats.

Of course the allure of this place relies mainly on the ambiance and while it would be great to focus attention on the doughtnut chandelier for longer, I did appreciate how quickly the staff moves people through the lines at the register.  I can only imagine what drunk people do with the dozens of doughnut choices late at night and what they have to put up with.  But they were no jaded at all upon my visit.  They had the Portland niceness down pat.

Regarding the doughnuts, they have all kinds of flavors, they have the famous Voodoo doughnut, maple with bacon, maple, etc. for my first time, I got a half dozen of old fashioned, glazed, and blueberry which were all pretty good. Their glazed doughnut is pretty unique and bigger than your typical and average one. I love doughnuts and Voodoo is decently interesting. I would come back to try others.

With its masterful combination of sweet and salty, crunch and porous yeasted dough, that doughnut is too sexy for TV.  I had high hopes for the notorious doughnut, and I'm no stranger to bacon with sugar, but this thing blew my mind.  The doughnut itself was fluffy with a good amount of pull, and the thick strips of bacon on top were perfectly crispy.  The maple frosting was dreamy, and with the salty porky top, the doughnut was downright indecent.  It was, I believe, the best doughnut I've ever had and one of the best things I've eaten, period.

It was worth waiting in one of the slowest lines I've encountered of late.  We showed up at 11 AM on a Friday and there were a couple dozen people waiting outside of the shop.  It took a good half hour to get to the front of the line, and when we did, we saw why.  The shop is tiny.  There was one person working the register and getting the doughnuts, a friendly and, I might add, very cute girl.  The place has a lot of character packed into its small space - there's voodoo kitsch and Voodoo Doughnuts merchandise as well as a chalkboard menu on the walls.  Doughnuts rotate in a display case by the register, and there are hundreds and hundreds more in the space behind it.

Though there were several whacky doughnuts to choose from, we ended up getting pretty standard doughnuts other than the bacon maple bar.  Matt B. is a picky eater and went with a sugar cake doughnut and a cinnamon yeast doughnut.  I asked the cashier to pick my second doughnut and she recommended a simple blueberry cake doughnut.  All three of these doughnuts were great, though not nearly as memorable as the bacon maple.  The cake doughnuts had a nice dense, moist crumb and the blueberry had blueberries baked into the cake as well as cooked into the glaze.  Voodoo can do solid basics in addition to its more out there creations.

I can't imagine that anything else in Voodoo Doughnut is as good as the bacon maple bar.  It is the proverbial Chuck Norris of doughnuts.  Voodoo was one of our last stops before meeting Michael K. in Seattle, and with great willpower, I saved him a few bites.  Hours later, when most doughnuts are well past their prime, Mike had the same slack-in-the-face dropped jaw reaction I did.  I am sad that I can't have this doughnut whenever I want, and any time I find myself Portland, Voodoo Doughnut will be a top priority.",2010-10-25 07:25:02

Yes, this location is in the bad part of town. You're in a big city, so not every part is going to be pretty and affluent. We did see a few homeless people hanging around outside, but they did not bother us.

The line. This is what made me not want to go. After reading reviews, I thought we were going to have to wait hours for a doughnut, but there was virtually no wait. We went on a Monday night at 8pm and there were maybe 10 people in line. Between finding a place to park and being, we were there for a total of 15 minutes, if that. I think it really depends on when you go. 

My wife and I both got the voodoo doll. It was delicious and very cute. Personally, I thought all the doughnut flavors looked very unique and yummy. The atmosphere was unique as well. Very grungy, very kitschy.

I know some say they are too sweet, but for me the sweeter, the better! Both locations did have lines, but neither were ridiculously long. My only compliant is that Voodoo hasn't spread to DC.

The Voodoo was absolutely delicious. I loved the icing and was super surprised by the raspberry filling, accentuated by raspberry seeds which leads me to believe it's real -- not some red-dyed, sugared-up syrup. Yum.

And the Ring of Fire was superb as well. I loved the donut -- chocolate cake with sugar/cinnamon(?) and a dusting of cayenne. Super sweet with a touch of pain. Again, yum.

It is immediately south of Chinatown, across Burnside, and smack in the middle of the Old Town / Skidmore Fountain /  Downtown areas.

They are getting a 5 because of basic math.  I would give them a 5 if not crowded.  I will give them a 4 since it tends to be crowded.  So when are they NOT crowded?  I was told before 6 am.  Sorry, but the suburbs and a warm bed are more inviting at that time.  

On a cool late February day on which it was not raining, the line at about 12 noon took about 20 minutes to get into the door and another 5 minutes to order and pay.  This enabled me to make this doughnut run without having to feed a meter for which payment is required beginning at 1 pm on Sundays.

I had preselected 2 doughnuts based on looking at their website rather than hemming and hawing with indecision at the counter.  I opted for a Neapolitan doughnut and an Old Dirty Bastard doughnut.  The first is a more subtle chocolate cake doughnut with strawberry topping and some marshmallows and costs $1.15.  The second is an overload of  chocolate with toppings such as Oreos and peanut butter and costs $1.95.  Truth be told, the donuts were excellent.

Again, if the line was always long, and it often is, it can dissuade one from going.  However, a field trip every now and then is indeed worth it, based on what I saw and ate.  The time in line goes by fairly quickly because Portland's weirdness is on display, so even the people watching is pretty good.  Consider the neighborhood it's in and that there's a wall across the street proclaiming ""Keep Portland Weird.""",2014-02-25 05:07:41

""Bacon doughnut tastes like purple drank!""

Kudos, Voodoo! I'll be back when I'm in the neighborhood again.",2015-02-18 22:46:11

I got a box of a dozen and tried as many as I could get my hands on...the Cap'n Crunch was my hands down favourite. Despite the craziness of the place, the staff were patient, friendly, helpful and fun. This is one of the few places where they live up to the hype.",2019-11-11 14:25:38

These donuts are so good people will carry the pink box all the way home and then share with their families.  Very cool tradition for the 2020 lifestyle of the ""rich and famous."" Recognize that some people actually have to set there cell phones down to carry this pink box.  And if you don't like the cock and balls try the maple bar kit cat!",2020-03-12 04:02:18

My personal favorites are the mango tango and the Portland creme, but they're all amazing. For example, the topping on the homer tastes like strawberry milk. The only reason it's not my favorite is because I'm not a huge fan of yeast donuts unless they have filling. 
Did I mention basically everything is vegan? Definitely double check beforehand to be safe but almost everything is good to go. 
Shoutout to Kitty for making my experience extra awesome, you're the best!",2019-07-12 07:58:19

These are not only the best doughnuts in Portland but in the entire U.S.A. I've been to top shops all over the nation, so I have some credibility. 

A trip to Voodoo should be treated as a culinary adventure, not simply a tourist stop. My mother and I were lucky to be in line behind a nice couple from Olympia, WA who make a pilgrimage to Voodoo every year. Being Voodoo experts, they recommended their favorite varieties to us, so we had a crystal clear picture of the half dozen doughnuts to select once we reached the front of the line. We had to wait about 45 minutes but the time passed by quickly because of the fun conversations with fellow customers around us.

For our six doughnut creations, we selected the Mango Tango, Old Dirty Bastard, Ain't That A Peach Fritter, Voodoo, Maple Bacon, and Blueberry Cake. Each was distinctly unique, had tasty flavor combinations, and were really fresh.

Love live Voodoo Doughnut! And please put a location in San Diego if it's not too much trouble ;)",2015-08-20 02:43:01

Granted there's typically a 20-30min wait time, but that just shows how good they are.
When I finally entered the bakery, it definitely felt like the Hot Topic of Donuts.

I was so excited for the different options to choose from. They have a menu on the wall, & donuts in the display window. I wanted everything! 
If you're interested on trying different/multiple donuts, you have 2 options: buy an assorted box of your choice, OR the server chooses half & you choose the other half. 
In all honestly, I don't think you could go wrong with either option.

I finally made my selection. Some donuts were pretty normal, other donuts were out there (even some adult themed - which I didn't get!)
Everything was delicious. Bacon Maple Bar was my fav!!!

I'm definitely coming back next time I'm in Portland!",2017-04-11 06:23:10
