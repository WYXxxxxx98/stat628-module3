Yixuan Wang:
EDA of Bakeries: The histogram and word frequency plot was made in this file. Also in this file, I made a sentimental analysis with packages, and using the polarity as another criterion combined with stars to divide all the reviews into good and bad reviews. Then, delete the word with all spells of doughnuts. The word frequency of useful good and bad reviews is also generated by this file.
